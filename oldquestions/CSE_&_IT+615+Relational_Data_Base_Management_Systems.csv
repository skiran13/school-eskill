When an attribute of a relation is the foreign key in another relation, deleting it causes referential integrity problems. The on delete cascade solves this problem by forcing us to delete the foreign key first. "
Question 84,"5.	What does the following condition do?","check( name in( ïRyanÍ, ïCristianoÍ, ïLeoÍ))","a)	The condition checks whether the name attribute includes the three mentioned names","b)	The condition allows the name attribute to possess only the three mentioned names","c)	The condition checks whether the given names are sub-strings in at least one of the values",b,Explanation: The check clause allows the attribute to take only those values that are explicitly specified by the user inside the parentheses after the in key word. 
Question 85,"6.	Referential integrity constraints are also called as _________","a)	Functional dependencies","b)	Subset dependencies","c)	Superset dependencies","d)	Primary dependencies",b,Explanation: Referential integrity constraints are also called as subset dependencies.
