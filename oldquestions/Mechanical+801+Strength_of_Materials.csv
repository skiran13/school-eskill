What is the bending moment at end supports of a simply supported beam?,a) Maximum,b) Minimum,c) Zero,d) Uniform,c,"Explanation: At the end supports, the moment (couple) developed is zero, because there is no distance to take the perpendicular acting load. As the distance is zero, the moment is obviously zero."
Question 315,"2. What is the maximum shear force, when a cantilever beam is loaded with udl throughout?",a) w_l,b) w,c) w/l,d) w+l,a,"Explanation: In cantilever beams, the maximum shear force occurs at the fixed end. In the free end, there is zero shear force. As we need to convert the udl in to load, we multiply the length of the cantilever beam with udl acting upon. For maximum shear force to obtain we ought to multiply load and distance and it surely occurs at the fixed end (w_l)."
Question 316,"3. Sagging, the bending moment occurs at the _____ of the beam.",a) At supports,b) Mid span,c) Point of contraflexure,d) Point of emergence,b,"Explanation: The positive bending moment is considered when it causes convexity downward or concavity at top. This is sagging. In simply supported beams, it occurs at mid span because the bending moment at the supports obviously will be zero hence the positive bending moment occurs in the mid span."
Question 317,5. What is the maximum bending moment for simply supported beam carrying a point load “W” kN  at its centre.,a) W kNm,b) W/m kNm,c) W_l kNm,d) W_l/4 kNm,d,"Explanation: We know that, in simply supported beams the maximum BM occurs at the central span.Moment at A = Moment at B = 0Moment at C = W/2  _  l/2      = Wl/ 4 kNm ( Sagging )."
Question 318,6. How do point loads and udl be represented in SFD?,a) Simple lines and curved lines,b) Curved lines and inclined lines,c) Simple lines and inclined lines,d) Cant represent any more,c,"Explanation: According to BIS, the standard symbols used for sketching SFD arePoint load      =     ———–Udl    load       =     \"
Question 319,7. ________ curve is formed due to bending of over hanging beams.,a) Elastic,b) Plastic,c) Flexural,d) Axial,a,Explanation: The line to which the longitudinal axis of a beam bends or deflects or deviates under given load is known as elastic curve on deflection curve. Elastic curve can also be known as elastic line or elastic axis.
Question 320,8. The relation between slope and maximum bending moment is _________,a) Directly proportion,b) Inversely proportion,c) Relative proportion,d) Mutual incidence,b,"Explanation: The relationship between slope and maximum bending moment is inversely proportional because, For example in simply supported beams slope is maximum at supports and zero at midspan of a symmetrically loaded beam where as bending moment is zero at supports and maximum at mid span. Hence we conclude that slope and maximum bending moment are inversely proportional to each other in a case of simply supported beam."
Question 321,"1. In simple bending, ______ is constant.",a) Shear force,b) Loading,c) Deformation,d) Bending moment,d,"Explanation: If a beam is undergone with simple bending, the beam deforms under the action of bending moment.  If this bending moment is constant and does not affected by any shear force, then the beam is in state of simple bending."
Question 322,"2. If a beam is subjected to pure bending, then the deformation of beam is_____",a) Arc of circle,b) Triangular,c) Trapezoidal,d) Rectangular,a,"Explanation: The beam being subjected to pure bending, there will be only bending moment and no shear force it results in the formation of an arc of circle with some radius known as radius of curvature."
Question 323,"3. When a beam is subjected to simple bending, ____________ is same in both tension and compression for the material.",a) Modulus of rigidity,b) Modulus of elasticity,c) Poisson’s ratio,d) Modulus of section,b,Explanation: It is one of the most important assumptions made in the theory of simple bending that is the modulus of elasticity that is Young’s modulus [E]  is same in both tension and compression for the material and the stress in a beam do not exceed the elastic limit.
Question 324,5. Maximum Shearing stress in a beam is at _____,a) Neutral axis,b) Extreme fibres,c) Mid span,d) Action of loading,a,Explanation: Shearing stress is defined as the resistance offered by the internal stress to the shear force. Shearing stress in a beam is maximum at neutral axis.
Question 325,"6. At the neutral axis, bending stress is _____",a) Minimum,b) Maximum,c) Zero,d) Constant,c,"Explanation: Neutral axis is defined as a line of intersection of neutral plane or neutral layer on a cross section at the neutral axis of that section.  At the NA, bending stress or bending strain is zero. The first moment of area of a beam section about neutral axis is also zero. The layer of neutral axis neither contracts nor extends."
Question 326,7. Curvature of the beam is __________ to bending moment.,a) Equal,b) Directly proportion,c) Inversely proportion,d) Coincides,b,"Explanation:  From the flexural equation, we have 1/R is called as the “curvature of the beam”.        1 / R = M / EIHence the curvature of the beam is directly proportional to bending moment and inversely proportional to flexural rigidity (EI)."
Question 327,8. What are the units of flexural rigidity?,a) Nm2,b) Nm,c) N/m,d) m/N3,a,"Explanation: The product of young’s modulus (E) of the material and moment of inertia (I) of the beam section about its neutral axis is called flexural rigidity.Units for E are N/m2Units for I are m4Their product is Nm2."
Question 328,9. What are the units for section modulus?,a) m2,b) m4,c) m3,d) m,c,"Explanation: The ratio of moment of inertia to the distance to the extreme fibre is called modulus of section or section modulus. It is generally denoted by the letter Z.  Section modulus is expressed in m3Z = I/y    = m4/ m    = m3 ."
Question 329,10. What are the units of axial stiffness?,a) m3,b) m2,c) N/ m,d) -m,c,Explanation: Axial rigidity is a product of young’s modulus (E) and the cross-sectional area (A) of that section. Axial rigidity per unit length is known as axial stiffness the s i units of axial stiffness are Newton per metre (N/m).
