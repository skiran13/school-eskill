A provider which produces 99 percent uptime ________,a) Security issues,b) Network Issues,c) Programming issue,d) Memory issue,b,"Explanation: Among the exceptions that release a provider from providing 99 percent uptime are network issues not within their direct control, client negligence, ñacts of god,î scheduling maintenance and more."
Question 994,"6. With physical security, the stakes are incredibly ________",a) Very high,b) Low,c) Very low,d) High,d,"Explanation: With physical security, the stakes are incredibly high, so even if you are working with a limited budget, cloud services are not an area where you should shop for a bargain."
Question 995,"7. Issue with connecting to data stored have anything to do with data centers.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: The reality is that any issues with connecting to data stored in the cloud rarely have anything to do with the service providerÍs data center.
Question 996,8. The most likely culprit is ________,a) Things,b) Network,c) Device,d) Internet connectivity,d," Explanation: The most likely culprit is internet connectivity, leaving end users unable to access their hosted data or even perform management functions."
Question 997,9. ________ are designed to protect data and servers.,a) Physical walls,b) Logical firewalls,c) Both Physical and logical,d) Neither physical nor logical,c,Explanation: Physical and logical firewalls measure are designed to protect data and the servers where it is stored from theft. Sabotage and damage caused by natural disasters.
Question 998,10. Communication between ________ and ________ is encrypted for security.,a) Cloud and device,b) End user and data center,c) Network and device,d) Cloud and Network,b,Explanation: Communication between end user sites and data centre is encrypted according to industry standards to further improve system security.
Question 999,"11. Undertaking the intervention over an extended period of time would enhance the change of gaining access.a) Trueb) FalseView Answer",,,,,a,Explanation: Undertaking the intervention over an extended period of time would enhance the change of gaining access to revelation about the thinking of biology teachers.
Question 1000,12. ________ phase starts with the construction of spanning tree for ordinary routing information.,a) Initialization,b) Message Relaying,c) Selective recovery,d) Lost message detection,a,Explanation: Initialization phase starts with the construction of spanning tree for ordinary routing information. A level corresponds to the hop distance of the node from the sink and data will be transmitted.
Question 1001,13. In which phase packets are forwarded hop by hop to get closer to the sink?,a) Initialization,b) Message Relaying,c) Selective recovery,d) Lost message detection,b,Explanation: Packets are forwarded hop by hop to get closer to the sink. Intermediate nodes keep the packetId in their buffer during Tcol corresponding to the maximum delay allowed to transmit.
Question 1002,14. ________ is achieved using over hearing mechanism.,a) Initialization,b) Message Relaying,c) Selective recovery,d) Lost message detection,d,"Explanation: The lost message detection is achieved by over hearing mechanism.  Upon sensing the channel, if node A does not hear node B transmitting the packet packetId to its next hop, it becomes aware that the packet has been lost and that are transmission is required."
Question 1003,15. What is the last step in algorithm for reliable data transfer?,a) Initialization,b) Message Relaying,c) Selective recovery,d) Lost message detection,c,"Explanation: Once a packet is detected, the AJIA mechanism relies on its routing metric to choose the best next hop for the packet re transmission."
