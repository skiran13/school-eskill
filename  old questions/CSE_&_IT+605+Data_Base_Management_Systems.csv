Question 810,10. ______________ rolls back all transactions that were incomplete at the time of crash.,a) Analysis pass,b) Redo pass,c) Undo pass,d) None of the mentioned,c,"Explanation: It performs a single backward scan of the log, undoing all transactions in undo-list."
Question 811,"1. Which lock should be obtained to prevent a concurrent transaction from executing a conflicting read, insert or delete operation on the same key value.",a) Higher-level lock,b) Lower-level lock,c) Read only lock,d) Read write,a,"Explanation: Operations acquire lower-level locks while they execute, but release them when they complete; the corresponding transaction must however retain a higher-level lock in a two-phase manner to prevent concurrent transactions from executing conflicting actions."
Question 812,"2. Once the lower-level lock is released, the operation cannot be undone by using the old values of updated data items, and must instead be undone by executing a compensating operation; such an operation is called",a) Logical operation,b) Redo operation,c) Logical undo operation,d) Undo operation,a,Explanation: It is important that the lower-level locks acquired during an operation are sufficient to perform a subsequent logical undo of the operation.
Question 813,3. Which of the following is used for undo operations alone ?,a) Logical logging,b) Physical logging,c) Physical log records,d) Physical logging and Physical log records,a,"Explanation: If the operation inserted an entry in a B+-tree, the undo information U would indicate that a deletion operation is to be performed, and would identify the B+-tree and what entry to delete from the tree. Such logging of information about operations is called logical logging."
Question 814,4. Redo operations are performed exclusively using,a) Logical logging,b) Physical logging,c) Physical log records,d) Both Physical logging and Physical log records,d,Explanation: Logging of old-value and new-value information is called physical logging.
Question 815,"5. To perform logical redo or undo, the database state on disk must be operation ___________ that is, it should not have partial effects of any operation.",a) Persistent,b) Resistant,c) Consistent,d) None of the mentioned,c,"Explanation: Data structures such as B+-trees would not be in a consistent state, and neither logical redo nor logical undo operations can be performed on an inconsistent data structure."
Question 816,6. An operation is said to be __________ if executing it several times in a row gives the same result as executing it once.,a) Idempotent,b) Changed,c) Repetitive,d) All of the above,a,"Explanation: Operations such as inserting an entry into a B+-tree may not be idempotent, and the recovery algorithm must therefore make sure that an operation that has already been performed is not performed again."
Question 817,7. Immediate database modification technique uses,a) Both undo and redo,b) Undo but no redo,c) Redo but no undo,d) Neither undo nor redo,a,Explanation: Undo erases all the changes and redo makes the deleted changes.
Question 818,8. Shadow paging has,a) no redo,b) no undo,c) redo but no undo,d) neither redo nor undo,a,Explanation: Undo erases all the changes and redo makes the deleted changes.
Question 819,"9. For correct behaviour during recovery, undo and redo operation must be",a) Commutative,b) Associative,c) Idempotent,d) Distributive,c,Explanation: Undo erases all the changes and redo makes the deleted changes.
Question 820,10. If ___________ are not obtained in undo operation it will cause problem in undo-phase.,a) Higher-level lock,b) Lower-level lock,c) Read only lock,d) Read write,b,"Explanation: Operations acquire lower-level locks while they execute, but release them when they complete; the corresponding transaction must however retain a higher-level lock in a two-phase manner to prevent concurrent transactions from executing conflicting actions."
Question 821,1. The remote backup site is sometimes also called the,a) Primary Site,b) Secondary Site,c) Tertiary Site,d) None of the mentioned,b,"Explanation: We can achieve high availability by performing transaction processing at one site, called the primary site, and having a remote backup site where all the data from the primary site are replicated."
Question 822,2. Remote backup system must be _________ with the primary site.,a) Synchronised,b) Separated,c) Connected,d) Detached but related,a,"Explanation: We can achieve high availability by performing transaction processing at one site, called the primary site, and having a remote backup site where all the data from the primary site are replicated."
Question 823,3. The backup is taken by,a) Erasing all previous records,b) Entering the new records,c) Sending all log records from primary site to the remote backup site,d) Sending selected records from primary site to the remote backup site,c,"Explanation: We can achieve high availability by performing transaction processing at one site, called the primary site, and having a remote backup site where all the data from the primary site are replicated."
Question 824,4. When the __________ the backup site takes over processing and becomes the primary.,a) Secondary fails,b) Backup recovers,c) Primary fails,d) None of the mentioned,c,"Explanation: When the original primary site recovers, it can either play the role of remote backup, or take over the role of primary site again."
Question 825,5. The simplest way of transferring control is for the old primary to receive __________ from the old backup site.,a) Undo logs,b) Redo Logs,c) Primary Logs,d) All of the mentioned,c,"Explanation: If control must be transferred back, the old backup site can pretend to have failed, resulting in the old primary taking over."
Question 826,6. The time to process the remote backup can be reduced by,a) Flags,b) Breakpoints,c) Redo points,d) Checkpoints,d,"Explanation: If the log at the remote backup grows large, recovery will take a long time. The remote backup site can periodically process the redo log records that it has received and can perform a checkpoint, so that earlier parts of the log can be deleted."
Question 827,7. A _______________ configuration can make takeover by the backup site almost instantaneous.,a) Hot-spare,b) Remote,c) Direct,d) Spare,d,"Explanation: In this configuration, the remote backup site continually processes redo log records as they arrive, applying the updates locally."
Question 828,8. A transaction commits as soon as its commit log record is written to stable storage at the primary site. This is,a) One Safe,b) Two Safe,c) Two-very Safe,d) Very Safe,a,"Explanation: The problem with this scheme is that the updates of a committed transaction may not have made it to the backup site, when the backup site takes over processing."
Question 829,9. A transaction commits as soon as its commit log record is written to stable storage at the primary and the backup site.This is,a) One Safe,b) Two Safe,c) Two-very Safe,d) Very Safe,c,Explanation: The problem with this scheme is that transaction processing cannot proceed if either the primary or the backup site is down.
Question 830,"10. If only the primary is active, the transaction is allowed to commit as soon as its commit log record is written to stable storage at the primary site. This is",a) One Safe,b) Two Safe,c) Two-very Safe,d) Very Safe,b,"Explanation: This scheme provides better availability than does two-very-safe,while avoiding the problem of lost transactions faced by the one-safe scheme."
