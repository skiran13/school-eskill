If the positive lead of a DMM, with the mode set to ohmmeter is connected to the base and the negative lead to the emitter and a high resistance reading is obtained, then what is the type of transistor that is being tested?",a) npn,b) pnp,c) faulty,d) none of the mentioned,a,"Explanation:If the positive lead of a DMM, with the mode set to ohmmeter is connected to the base and the negative lead to the emitter and a low resistance reading is obtained, then what is the type of transistor that is being tested is npn."
Question 343,1. Whichof the following is the correct relatioship between IB and IE?,a) IB = _ IE,b) IB = IE,c) IB = (_ + 1) IE,d) IE = (_ + 1) IB,d,"Explanation: For a BJT, the collector and emitter current are related as IE = (_ + 1) IB."
Question 344,"2. For best operation of a BJT, which region must the operating point be set at?",a) Active region,b) Cutoff region,c) Saturation region,d) None of thye mentioned,a,"Explanation: Operating point for a BJT must always be set in the active region to ensure proper functioning. Setting up of Q-point in any other region may lead to reduced functionality."
