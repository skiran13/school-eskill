Question 1,2. Which of the following function of DNA is necessary for the purpose of evolution?,a) Replication,b) Transcription,c) Translation,d) Mutation,d,"Explanation: Mutation facilitates the change of bases within a DNA and if this change encodes for a viable amino acid which in turn may lead to the synthesis of a different protein. This protein exerts a phenotypic character to the organism which may be different from the wild type character or may generate a unique character itself, thus leading to evolution."
Question 2,"3. According to the phenotypic characters of pneumococcus considered in GriffithÍs experiment of transformation, which of the following statements are correct?",i) Presence of slime layer,ii) Presence of capsule,iii) Absence of capsule,iv) Type of adhesion,c,"Explanation: As the two phenotypic characteristics of importance in GriffithÍs experiment of transformation are:-i) Presence or absence of polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the bacterial cell which is responsible for its characteristic smooth or rough colonies respectivelyii) The type of capsule i.e., the specific molecular composition of the polysaccharide present in the capsule coded by its genome, thus triggering immune response of a specific type."
Question 3,4. Which of the following combination is a correct observation for the transformation experiment performed by Griffith?,a) Type IIIS (living) + mouse = dead,b) Type IIIS (heat killed) + mouse = dead,c) Type IIR (living) + mouse = dead,d) Type IIIS (heat killed) + type IIR (living) + mouse = living,a,Explanation: Type IIIS strain means smooth strain of pneumococci which is virulent in nature. If this strain is injected alive in a mouse it is bound to develop the disease and thus fall dead.
Question 4,5. Fredrick GriffithÍs experiment involving Streptococcus pneumoniae lead to the discovery of____________,a) DNA as genetic material,b) RNA as genetic material,c) Protein as genetic material,d) Transforming principle,d,"Explanation: When heat killed virulent (smooth) type bacteria were injected in the mouse along with the living avirulent (rough) type of bacteria the mouse developed the disease, which was an unlikely result. Moreover when the bacteria were isolated from the infected mouse they were found to be of the virulent type. Thus, it was believed that some factor from the heat killed virulent type bacteria transformed the avirulent to virulent type bacteria which was known to be as the transforming principle."
Question 5,6. Definite results proving DNA to be genetic material was given by __________,a) Fredrick Griffith,b) Hershey and Chase,"c) Avery, Macleod and MacCarty",d) Meselson and Stahl,c,"Explanation: Avery, Macleod and MacCarty in their experiment with pneumococcus strains type IIIS and type IIR they performed three separate experimental setups:-i) Using DNase to degrade DNAii) Using RNase to degrade RNAiii) Using Protease to degrade proteinsThus, when the separate combinations were injected into mice respectively the transforming principle was found to be DNA.Note- Only these three enzymes were used as only their subsequent substrates were the main factors which were in conflict to be the genetic material."
Question 6,7. Which of the following statements regarding the mechanism of transformation in Bacillus subtilis is false?,a) A competent bacteria contains a DNA receptor/translocation complex,"b) While translocation of exogenous DNA, both strands gets passage into the cell","c) While translocation of exogenous DNA, only one strand gets passage into the cell",d) The exogenous DNA recombines and incorporates itself in the chromosome of the recipient cell.,b,"Explanation: During the translocation of exogenous duplex DNA, one of its strands gets degraded by deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in the periplasmic space, thus allowing passage to only single stranded DNA molecule into the cell."
Question 7,8. What were the main criteria taken under consideration for the experiment by Hershey and Chase?,"a) DNA contains phosphorus, protein contains sulfur","b) Protein contains phosphorus, DNA contains sulfur",c) Both DNA and protein contains phosphorus and not sulphur,d) Both DNA and protein contains sulfur and not phosphorus,a,"Explanation: DNA contains phosphorus in phosphodiester linkage and do not contain any sulphur. DNA is primarily composed of phosphate, nucleotide bases and deoxyribose sugar. Whereas proteins are composed of sulfur containing amino acids."
Question 8,9. What combination of radiolabelling is correct in case of Hershey and ChaseÍs demonstration of DNA as genetic material in T2 bacteriophage?,"a) 31P, 35S","b) 31P, 32S","c) 31P, 14C","d) 31P, 12C",a,"Explanation: The two factors considered by Hershey and Chase were the simple composition of T2 bacteriophage, that is, DNA and protein. Thus radiolabelling of only one element was required. 32P and 35S being the two radioactive isotopes, therefore, the combination of either 32P, 32S or 31P, 35S was used."
Question 9,"10. Recently, scientists have developed a procedure in which protoplasts of E. coli could be directly infected with the phage DNA. This process is termed as_________",a) Transformation,b) Transduction,c) Transfection,d) Mutation,c,"Explanation: Transfection is the process of introduction of exogenous, naked and purified nucleic acid in any organism. In case of transformation the introduction of nucleic acid is via a plasmid or any such vector. Transduction is the process of introduction of nucleic acid via viral vector. Lastly mutation is the alteration of nucleic acid at its composition level, is has nothing to do with DNA transfer."
Question 10,11. According to MendelÍs experiments gene carry genetic information from parents to offspringÍs. On which plant did he perform his experiments?,a) Oryza sativa,b) Pisum sativam,c) Allium cepa,d) Vitis vinifera,b,"Explanation: As we know, Gregor Mendel performed his experiments on garden pea plants whose scientific name is Pisum sativam.

Question 11,12. Plasmids are ____________,a) Double stranded DNA,b) Circular double stranded DNA,c) Linear double stranded DNA,d) Supercoiled circular double stranded DNA,b,"Explanation: Found mostly in prokaryotic cells, plasmids are extra chromosomalauto replicating small circular double stranded DNA which generally carries certain genes for the advantage of bacteria, such as, antibiotic resistance."
Question 12,13. What stores the genetic information in DNA?,a) Sugar,b) Phosphate,c) Nitrogenous base,d) Polymerase,c,"Explanation: Genetic information is stored in the sequence of nitrogenous base as they are of four types and they are A, T, G and C. The order of their occurrence decides the mRNA sequence which in turn codes amino acids and leading to synthesis of proteins. Sugars and phosphates form the backbone and are common to all, whereas polymerase helps in the replication of DNA template."
Question 13,15. What is the major type of RNA produced in the cell required for translation?,a) mRNA,b) tRNA,c) rRNA,d) siRNA,c,"Explanation: Generally, rRNA is of 4 types 28S, 5.8S, 18S and 5S. These subunits comprises the 80% of the total amount of RNA produced in a cell and are majorly required for translation as these rRNAs along with proteins form ribosomes which reads the codes for translation."
Question 14,1. Which macromolecule is not abundantly found though being of critical importance for biological mechanism?,a) Proteins,b) Lipids,c) Nucleic acids,d) Polysaccharides,b,"Explanation: Though lipids is of essential use in the cell for the formation of cell wall it is a micro molecule and is generally found in association with either phosphate or polysaccharide. In case of the other three they are all macromolecules and are of essential use for the cell. For example:  proteins such as, enzymes regulates biological functions, nucleic acids carry genetic information and polysaccharides functions as either storage of energy or acts as structural polymers."
Question 15,2. Which of the following is wrongly paired?,a) Proteins _ peptide bond,b) Nucleic acid _ hydrogen bond,c) Polysaccharide _ glycosidic bond,d) Phospholipids _phosphate linkage,b,"Explanation: Nucleic acids, that is, DNA and RNA show phosphodiesterase linkage which is the major type of linkage. Without the phosphodiester bonds between the phosphate and adjacent 3ÍOH sugar molecule the backbone will not be formed. Therefore, the nucleotides would not be able to attach and bond to form a nucleic acid."
Question 16,3. With respect to nucleosides which of the following is paired correctly?,"a) Purine _ Adenosine, Thymidine","b) Purine _ Guanosine, Thymidine","c) Pyrimidine _ Uridine, Cytidine","d) Pyrimidine _ Uridine, Adenosine",c,"Explanation: As we know purines have a fused ring structure with 9 element backbones ring structure. They are of two types Adenosine and Guanine. Again, the other three residues cytidine, Thymidine and Uridine are pyrimidines having a ring structure of 6 elements in the core backbone. Thus the correct pair among the above options is pyrimidine _ uridine, cytidine."
Question 17,4. Which of the following is not a component of the nucleic acid backbone?,a) Pentose sugar,b) Phosphate group,c) Nucleotide,d) Phosphodiesterase bond,c,"Explanation: A nucleic acid backbone is mainly composed of a pentose-phosphate unit which acts as a monomer. The repeat of this monomer is attached together by the phosphodiesterase linkage, thus, giving rise to the backbone. The nucleotides attached to the sugar moieties forms the side chain which gives rise to the hydrogen linkage with its complementary strand."
Question 18,5. According to ChargaffÍs rule the two strands of DNA has ___________,a) Same molecular weight,b) Same amount of A and G,c) Different amount of A and G,d) Different molecular weight,d,"Explanation: According to ChargaffÍs rule the two strands have equal number of A and T residues and equal number of G and C residues. Thus when in one strand A is more automatically in the other T is more. Thus, A being a pyrimidine has a higher molecular weight than T, which is a purine, and so the two strands have different molecular weight. The same happens in case of G and C also."
Question 19,6. In one strand of a double stranded DNA the rate of occurrence of A is 3 times C in consecutive 10 bases. So how many G will be there in 100 base pairs of a DNA duplex?[Consider G=T in one strand].,a) 30,b) 20,c) 40,d) 60,c,"Explanation: LetÍs consider C = 1Therefore, A = 3C = (3*1) = 3Now, A+C = (3+1) = 4Again G = T [given]And A+C+G+T = 10 [given]Now replacing T with G and putting the value of A+CWe get,4 + 2G = 102G = 6G = 3, T = 3, A = 3, C = 1Thus in 100 bases in one strand there are (3*10 = 30) G residuesNow for the complementary strand G = C residues [ChargaffÍs rule]Therefore, C = G = 1 residue in every 10 basesThat is, G = 1*10 = 10 in 100 basesTherefore total number of G residues = 30 + 10 = 40 in 100 base pairs of a DNA duplex."
Question 20,"7. In a diploid organism with 30,000 bases haploid genome contains 23% A residues. What is the number of G residues in the genome of this organism?",a) 16000,b) 16200,c) 16500,d) 14200,b,"Explanation: By ChargaffÍs rule, A = T = 23%Therefore, G + C = [100 _ (A+T)] G + C = [100 _ 46] G + C = 54 G = C = 27 [By ChargaffÍs rule] Therefore, G = 27% Now, each cell is diploid thus it contains (2*30,000 = 60,000) basesSo, G = 27% of 60,000 G = 16,200 bases. "
Question 21,8. Which of the following is not a characteristic of nucleotide bases?,a) Planar,b) Heterocyclic,c) Aliphatic,d) Ubiquitous,c,"Explanation: The nucleotide bases have a 6 member ring structure as one component which is common for all five bases. Thus, they are considered as aromatic molecules due to the presence of a benzene ring structure which provides the molecules with an aromatic property."
Question 22,9. Which of the following factors do not provide to the separation of DNA fragments during electrophoresis?,a) ChargaffÍs rule,b) Matrix density,c) Ethidium bromide,d) Size,c,"Explanation: Ethidium bromide only helps in tagging the DNA molecules to make the visible under the UV radiation due to its fluorescence property, but does not take any part in the separation of DNA molecules during electrophoresis."
Question 23,10. Which one of the following is not a function of a nucleotide?,a) Nucleic acid monomer,b) Ribozyme,c) Energy carrier molecules,d) Receptors,d,Explanation: Nucleotides do not form receptor molecules. Receptor molecules are generally polysaccharide molecules or protein molecules which can have structural configurations. Energy carrying nucleotide molecules such as ATP helps binding and unbinding of signal molecules to these receptors thus facilitating different biological functions.
Question 24,1. The first X-ray diffraction patterns of DNA were taken in 1938 by ___________,a) William Asbury,b) Rosalind Franklin,c) Francis H. Crick,d) Linus Pauling,a,Explanation: The first X_ray diffraction patterns of DNA of low quality taken in 1983 by William Asbury. He used using DNA supplied by Ola Hammarsten and Torbjorn Caspersson.

Question 27,4. What should be the complementary strand of 3Í.ATGGCTTGA.5Í?,a) 3Í.TACCGAACT.5Í,b) 5Í.TACCGAACT.3Í,c) 3Í.TAGGCAAGT.5Í,d) 5Í.TAGGCAAGT.3Í,b,"Explanation: The complementary of A is T and for G is C, therefore the complementary sequence should be .TACCGAACT. . And the two strands are antiparallel as the given strand is in 3Í to 5Í direction the complementary strand should be in 5Í to 3Í direction."
Question 28,5. The hydrogen bonds formed during A and T bonding occurs between C6NH2 of A and _____,a) C4O of T,b) PO3_,c) C6O of A,d) C1O of T,a,Explanation: As the sugar molecule is connected to N1 in T the C4O and C1O are free. Also the C1O is farthest from C6NH2 thus the bond forms between C6NH2 and C4O. This stabilizes the model because of being in preferred tautomeric state.
Question 29,6. In a DNA double helix the bases are held together by hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds are _________,a) Covalent bonds,b) Non-covalent bonds,c) Ionic bonds,d) Van der Waals forces,b,Explanation: Hydrogen bond is a weak non covalent bond. This occurs between two molecules resulting from an electrostatic attraction between a proton and an electronegative atom of the other molecule. No share of electron takes place which is the criteria for non-covalent bonding.
Question 30,"8. With respect to the importance of hydrogen bonding and DNA double helix stability, which of the following statements is false?",a) Favorable tautomeric form of nucleotide bases,b) Contributes to the thermodynamic stability,c) Decreases the entropy,d) Specificity of base pairing,c,"Explanation: When the two complementary strands of DNA comes together in an aqueous solution the water molecules attached to the polynucleotide strands are displaced from the bases. This creates disorder and this increases the entropy. Therefore, it finally increases the stability of the DNA duplex."
Question 31,9. In the late 1970s non double helical form of DNA was also suggested but was discarded on the basis of certain factors. Which of the following is not a factor responsible?,a) X-ray crystallography,b) Nuclein,c) Topoisomerase,d) Nucleosome core particle,b,"Explanation: Nuclein, later named as nucleic acid and eventually DNA was first discovered by Swiss physiological chemist Friedrich Miescher inside the nuclei of human WBCs in 1869. Thus nuclein is not a term related to the structural orientation and chemical nature of DNA."
Question 32,"10. Levene investigated and found that the nucleic acid is composed of poly-nucleotides and each nucleotide is composed of one base, a sugar molecule and a phosphate. This was performed on the genome of________________",a) Bacteria,b) Fungi,c) WBCs,d) Yeast,d,"Explanation: Levene placed his initial proposal of nucleic acids being composed of nucleotides and nucleotides being composed of one of the four bases, a phosphate and a sugar molecule in 1919. He gathered all his evidences regarding the structure were from the repeated experiments of hydrolysis and analysis of the yeast nucleic acid."
Question 33,1. Who were the first to suggest that one strand of DNA might act as a template for the synthesis of its complementary strand?,a) Meselson and Stahl,b) Watson and crick,c) Walter Flemming,d) Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins,b,Explanation:  In Watson and CrickÍs paper on the model of DNA double helix they ended with a statement that it had not escaped their notice that the specific pairing they had postulated immediately suggested that one strand might be the template for the complementary strand synthesis.

Herbert Taylor, Philip Wood and Walter Hughes on root tip cells of Vicia faba",c) Walter Flemming on root tip cells of Phaseolus vulgaris,"d) J. Herbert Taylor, Philip Wood and Walter Hughes on root tip cells of Phaseolus vulgaris",b,"Explanation:  as Walter Flemming discovered cell division not semi conservative nature of replication. Semiconservative nature of replication was first demonstrated by J. Herbert Taylor, Philip Wood and Walter Hughes on root tip cells of broad bean which is the common name for Vicia faba."
Question 35,3. Watson and CrickÍs suggestion of the complementary strand synthesis taking one of the parent strand as template was proposed in _________,a) 1869,b) 1909,c) 1953,d) 1952,c,Explanation: As Watson and CrickÍs paper on structure of DNA was published in 1953 they ended their journal suggesting the possibility of the synthesis of complementary strand taking one of the parent strands as the template.
Question 36,4. Which of the following statements is true with respect to the DNA double helix?,a) Composed of two or more polynucleotide chains,b) The base pairs have opposite polarity,c) Covalent bond exists in base pairing,d) T is transcribed as U,b,Explanation: The two strands having complementary base pairing have the same helical geometry but have opposite polarity. This is because the strands are held together are antiparallel in nature.
Question 37,"5. Who, in which year showed firm enzymological proof that DNA alone functions as the template for the synthesis of new DNA strands?",a) Watson and Crick in 1953,"b) Avery, MacCarty and Macleod in 1944",c) Meselson and Stahl in 1958,d) Hershey and Chase in 1952,c,"Explanation: Within five years of the discovery of the double helix, evidence emerged for the separation of the complementary strands during DNA replication as suggested by Watson and Crick. This firm enzymological proof was first provided by Meselson and StahlÍs experiment of Semiconservative way of replication of DNA in 1958."
Question 38,7. Which of the following regarding the basic mechanism of gene expression is correct?,a) DNA _> tRNA_> protein,b) RNA _> cDNA _> mRNA_> protein,c) RNA _> DNA_> mRNA _> protein,d) DNA _> protein,b,Explanation: Gene expression is carried forward from DNA to mRNA (transcription) and mRNA to protein (translation). To this RNA can be converted to cDNA by reverse transcription. Then the process is carry forwarded in the same manner.
Question 39,8. Which of the following does not take part in gene expression?,a) Replication,b) Transcription,c) RNA processing,d) Translation,a,"Explanation: Replication is the coping of the gene in double but plays no role in the production of protein thus, expression of gene. Transcription is the production of RNA from DNA and RNA processing is used for stabilizing the RNA in cytosol ad excision of non-coding regions. Translation is the major process which leads to the formation of polypeptide chain."
Question 40,10. Amino acids prior to their incorporation into polypeptide must be attached to a special adaptor molecule. Who proved this and when?,a) Francis H. Crick in 1955,b) Paul C. Zamecnic and Maholon B. Hoagland in 1957,c) James Watson and Francis H. Crick in 1953,d) Linus Pauling in 1950,b,Explanation: In 1955 Francis H. Crick proposed that prior to the incorporation of amino acids in polypeptide chain they must be attached to an adapter molecule which can interact with the three-nucleotide long coding units of mRNA. This was finally proved in 1957 by Paul C. Zamecnic and Maholon B. Hoagland. They demonstrated that amino acids were carried by the transfer RNAs (tRNA) to the ribosome for its transfer to the growing polypeptide chain.
Question 41,1. With respect to polymerization of amino acids which of the following statements is wrong?,a) The polymerization machinery consists of fifty proteins and two RNA molecules,b) Overall molecular mass 2.5 megadalton,c) Occurs at a slow pace of only 2 _ 20 amino acids per second,d) In eukaryotes the process occurs in the cytoplasm,a,"Explanation: Though the polymerizing machinery consists of 50 proteins, it atleast should consist of 3 RNA molecules. The molecules that take part in translation are mRNA, tRNA and rRNA. Messenger or mRNA is the transcript, transfer or tRNA is the carrier of amino acid and the ribosome contains rRNA or ribosomal RNA which decodes the transcript codon."
Question 42,3. Check which one of the following mechanisms is wrongly paired with its location of occurrence.,a) Transcription _ nucleus,b) Post transcriptional mechanism _ ER,c) Translation _ cytoplasm,d) Post translational mechanism _ ER,b,"Explanation: Post transcriptional mechanisms are splicing, capping and tailing. These three mechanisms occurs in the nucleus as if the nascent mRNA (hnRNA) leaves the nucleus without the modification ribosome would not be able to read it and also it would not be able to read it and also it would be hydrolysed by the enzyme RNase present in the cell cytoplasm."
Question 43,4. With respect to the subunits of ribosome which of the following is wrongly paired?,a) Ribosome = rRNA + protein,b) Large subunit = decoding center,c) Small subunit = decoding center,d) Subunit sedimentation unit = Svedberg,b,"Explanation: The large subunit contains the three sites A, P and E. These are the centers where the amino acyl tRNA brings the amino acid peptide linkage is formed and the tRNA exits respectively. Thus the subunit is known as peptidyl transferase center."
Question 44,5. An mRNA bearing multiple ribosomes is known as______________,a) Small subunit-mRNA-initiator tRNA complex,b) mRNA ribosome complex,c) Polyamine-ribosome complex,d) Polysome,d,Explanation: A single ribosome contacts around so nucleotides on mRNA whereas the due to the large density of ribosome it allows one ribosome per 80 nucleotides. Thus a typical mRNA could be very long (example: 1000 nucleotides). Therefore more than one ribosome can attach to the mRNA forming a structure known as polyribosome or polysome.
Question 45,6. What is the actual substrate for each round of amino acid addition?,a) Ribosome,b) Amino acid,c) mRNA,d) tRNA,d,Explanation: The actual substrate for the addition of amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain in each round are two charged species of t RNAs. They are an aminoacyl tRNA which is the carrier of amino acid to the ribosome-mRNA complex and the peptidyl tRNA which forms the peptide linkages between the amino acids.
Question 46,8. Where does ribosome gets the energy for the formation of peptide bond?,a) Breaking of the keto bond,b) Breaking of acyl bond,c) Simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP,d) Energy released during peptidyl transferase reaction,b,"Explanation: The energy provided for the formation of peptide bond is provided by the breaking of high energy acyl bonds. This is because the charging reaction of the tRNA involves the hydrolysis of a molecule of ATP. Thus, the energy of peptide bond formation originates from the molecule of ATP that was hydrolysed during tRNA charging reaction but not by simultaneous hydrolysis."
Question 47,9. With respect to the mRNA _ ribosome complex for translation mechanism which of the following pair is wrong?,a) Small subunit _ decoding center,b) A site _ aminoacylated tRNA binding site,c) P site _ peptidyl tRNA binding site,d) E site _ polypeptide exit site,d,Explanation: E site is the binding site for the tRNA that is released after the growing polypeptide chain has been transferred to the aminoacyl tRNA. Thus E site is the peptidyl tRNA exit site.
Question 48,11. How many channels are present in the ribosome?,a) 2,b) 3,c) 4,d) 5,b,Explanation: There are three channels present in the smaller subunit of ribosome which facilitates the entering and exit of the mRNA. The third channel is for the exit of the growing polypeptide chain.
Question 49,1. Which of the following is a character of ORF?,a) Contiguous,b) 3 _ nucleotide codons,c) Intron,d) Non _ overlapping,c,Explanation: Exons are the part of nascent RNA that are connected together to form RNA after the removal of introns by the splicosome. The splicosome in the complex formed in the nucleus with nascent RNA being the substrate for the formation of mature RNA after its splicing and other post transcriptional mechanism. 
Question 50,2. With respect to the open reading frame (ORF) which of the following is wrong?,a) Starts at 5Í end,b) ïAUGÍ is the only start codon for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,c) The start codon defines the reading frame for all the subsequent codons,d) The stop codon is distinct from the ends of the mRNA,b,"Explanation: ïAUGÍ is the only start codon for eukaryotes. For prokaryotic system ïAUGÍ, ïGUGÍ and sometimes even ïUUGÍ act as the start codon. "
Question 51,3. With respect to polycistronic mRNAs which of the following is wrong?,a) Multiple ORFs,b) Found in eukaryotes,c) Encodes proteins with related functions,d) Multiple polypeptide chain,b,Explanation: Eukaryotes only contain 1 ORF per mRNA and are thus monocistronic. Polycistronic mRNAs are generally found in prokaryotes with 2 or more ORFs. 
Question 52,4. What was the name of ribosome binding site?,a) ORF,b) RBS,c) A site,d) Shine _ Dalgarno sequence,c,"Explanation: Upstream the ORF a 3 _ 9 base pair sequence on the 5Í side of the sequence is identified as the ribosome binding site (RBS). This element is referred to as the Shine _ Dalgarno sequence, named after the scientists who discovered it by comparing the sequences of multiple mRNAs. "
Question 53,5. Which part of the ribosome identifies the Shine _ Dalgarno sequence?,a) Protein,b) 16S rRNA,c) 23S rRNA,d) 5S rRNA,b,"Explanation: The Shine _ Dalgarno sequence is identified by the 16S rRNA. The core of the 16S rRNA has the sequence of 5Í..CCUCCU..3Í and is located near the 3Í end of the rRNA. Not surprisingly the prokaryotic RBS are most often the subset of sequence 5Í..AGGAGG..3Í. Thus, 16S rRNA is the one that aligns the ribosome with the mRNA. "
Question 54,8. Which one of the following is the following is known as the Kozak sequence?,a) 5Í..CNNAUCG..3Í,b) 5Í..GNNAUGG..3Í,c) 5Í..TNNAUGG..3Í,d) 5Í..GNNAUGC..3Í,b,Explanation: The Kozak sequence is named after its identification by Marilyn Kozak. This sequence contains purines (A/G) three bases upstream of ïAUGÍ and a ïGÍ immediately following it. Thus the sequence stands up to 5Í..A/GNNAUGG..3Í. this sequence is known to increase translation efficiency. 
Question 55,9. With respect to the composition of ribosome which of the following is correct.,a) Ribosome is composed of 60S and 30S subunit,b) Eukaryotic ribosome small subunit contains only one 16S rRNA,c) 60S subunit consists of 5S rRNA and 23S rRNA,d) 60S and 40S makes up the 80S ribosome,d,"Explanation: There is a discrepancy in the sedimentation velocity of the subunits separately and as a whole. This is because of the fact that the sedimentation velocity is determined both by shape and size and hence, it is not an exact measure of mass. Prokaryotic ribosome consists of 50S and 30S subunit and the 30S subunit contains only one 16S rRNA. The 50S subunit consists of 5S and 23S rRNA. "
Question 56,10. Which element of the ribosome plays the key role in mRNA translation?,a) rRNA of the large subunit,b) Proteins of the large subunit,c) rRNA of the small subunit,d) Proteins of the small subunit,c,Explanation: The anticodon loops of the charged tRNA and the codons of the mRNA contacts the 16S rRNA. This 16S rRNA is present in the small subunit and plays the key role in mRNA translation even though all the rest needed without this 16S rRNA no translation would occur. 
Question 57,1. The 3Í end of tRNA is __________,a) 3Í CCA 5Í,b) 3Í ACC 5Í,c) 3Í CCG 5Í,d) 3Í GCC 5Í,b,Explanation: All tRNA has a conserved sequence of 3Í ACC 5Í. This sequence is conserved so as to facilitate cognate amino acid binding.
Question 58,3. With respect to tRNA which of the following is not its characteristic?,a) Complimentary region,b) Double helix molecule,c) Highly conserved pattern of fold,d) Variable loop,b,Explanation: The complementary region enables the tRNA to form limited stretches of double helix held together by base pairing. The other stretches of the tRNA are non _ complementary thus remain single stranded as loops. Thus the tRNA is a mixture of single and double stranded regions represented by the clover leaf model.
Question 59,4. How many loops are present in the clover leaf model of tRNA?,a) 2,b) 3,c) 4,d) 5,c,"Explanation: There are 4 loops and an acceptor stem in the clover leaf model of tRNA. The names of the 4 loops are _U loop, D loop, anticodon loop and the variable loop."
Question 60,5. Why the variable loop is named so?,a) Variable number of bases,b) Variable region,c) Multiple loops present,d) Variability of presence,a,Explanation: The variable loop sits between the anticodon loop and the _U loop and its region is fixed. The name is so given because they vary in size from 3 to 21 bases.
Question 61,6. The distance between the amino acid binding site and the anticodon site is ______,a) 64 ,b) 70 ,c) 76 ,d) 80 ,b,Explanation: X _ ray crystallography reveals the tRNA has an L _ shaped tertiary structure.

Question 62,7.  What is the angle between the D loop and the anticodon loop?,a) 45,b) 90,c) 135,d) 180,b,"Explanation: The X _ ray crystallography shows that the D loop and the _U loop comes together making the anticodon loop an extended helix. These to helices align at right angle, that is, 90 to each other in their tertiary structure."
Question 63,8. Which of the following does not contribute to the stability of tRNA?,a) Base and sugar _ phosphate backbone interaction,b) Hydrogen bonding,c) Hydrophobic interactions,d) Base pairing,c,"Explanation: Due to the negative charge of the tRNA backbone, it is unlikely for the molecule to have a hydrophobic nature. Thus, hydrophobic interactions do not play any role in the structural stability of the molecule. On the other hand, the other interactions such as the hydrogen bonding leads to base pairing which leads to its classic clover leaf model."
Question 64,"1. In the beads on a string model, the bead is made up of __________",a) 6 histone proteins,b) 8 histone proteins,c) 6 histone proteins and DNA,d) 8 histone proteins and DNA,b,Explanation: The ñbeads on a stringî model is for the nucleosome.

Nucleosome is made up of __________,"a) DNA, histone core protein","b) DNA, histone core protein, linker H1","c) RNA, histone core protein","d) RNA, histone core protein, linker H1",b,"Explanation: The core histone proteins are H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, over which the DNA is wrapped. Histone H1 is not a part of nucleosome core particle, instead it binds to the linker DNA and thus is referred to as linker histone. Thus, the histone core, linker histone and DNA are the components of the nucleosome."
Question 67,6. With respect to assembly of every core histone which of the following is wrong?,a) A conserved region,b) Histone fold domain,c) Disc shaped structure,d) 2 _ helices and an unstructured loop,d,Explanation: The histone fold is composed of 3 _ helices and two unstructured loops.

Question 71,10. Association of DNA and histone is mediated by_________,a) Covalent bonding,b) Hydrogen bonding,c) Hydrophobic bonding,d) Vander Waals interactions,b,"Explanation: Association of DNA and histone is mediated by a large number of hydrogen bonds, that is, 140 bonds. The majority forms between the protein and the oxygen of the phosphodiester backbone near the minor grove. Only 7 hydrogen bonds are made between the protein side chains and the bases in the minor groves of the DNA."
Question 72,2. The distinct zig _ zag appearance of the chromatin fibre is due to ____________,a) Nucleosome,b) Histone H1,c) Histone core,d) Linker DNA,b,Explanation: Histone H1 binding produces a more defined angle of DNA entry and exit from the nucleosome.

Question 75,5. What marks the difference between the solenoid and the zig _ zag models of 30 nm fibres?,a) Linker histone molecule,b) Linker DNA,c) Nucleosome structure,d) 10 nm fibre,b,"Explanation: Unlike the solenoid model, the zig _ zag conformation requires the linker DNA to pass through the central axis of the fibre in a relatively straight form. Thus, longer linker DNA favors this conformation. Because the average linker DNA varies between species, the form of the 30 nm fibre may not always be the same."
Question 76,7. Which of the following is not a characteristic of nuclear scaffold?,a) Associated with loops of 40 _ 90 kb,b) Topoisomerase I,c) SMC protein,d) Proteinacious in nature,b,"Explanation: Two classes of protein contributing to nuclear scaffold have been identified, that are, topoisomerase II and SMC protein. Presence of Topo II as a protein associated with the structure can be proved when the cells are treated with drugs which results in DNA breaks at the sites of Topo II DNA bindings. The treatment generates DNA fragments of about 50 kb size."
Question 77,8. Which histone molecule produces novel binding sites for protein components of the kinetochore?,a) CENP _ A,b) H2A,c) H3,d) H4,a,"Explanation: A histone variant CENP _ A, is associated with the nucleosome that include centromeric DNA. In this region CENP _ A replaces H3 subunit in the nucleosomes. These nucleosomes are incorporated into the kinetochore which mediates attachment of the chromosome to the mitotic spindle. The extended tail of CENP _ A may generate these novel binding sites for other binding protein components of the kinetochore."
Question 78,"9. With respect to remodeling complex of nucleosome, which of the following is not true?",a) Does not require ATP,b) Favors sliding of histone,c) Favors transfer of histone,d) Favors remodeling of histone,a,Explanation: The stability of the DNA-histone core interaction is influenced by large protein complexes referred to as nucleosome remodeling complexes.

Question 79,1. Which of the following facilitates nucleosome positioning?,a) Nucleosome remodeling complex,b) Topoisomerase II,c) SMC protein,d) DNA _ binding protein,d,"Explanation: Nucleosome positioning can be directed by DNA _ binding protein or particular DNA sequences. Just as many proteins cannot bind to DNA within the nucleosome, prior binding of a protein to a site on DNA can prevent association of the core histone with that stretch of DNA. If two such DNA _ binding proteins are bound to sites closer than the minimal nucleosomal DNA requirement (150 bp) the DNA stretch between the two proteins will remain nucleosome free."
Question 80,2. Which of the following regions promote histone _ DNA association?,"a) A, T","b) A, G","c) G, C","d) C, T",A,"Explanation: A:T rich DNA has an intrinsic tendency to bend toward the minor grove.

Question 82,4. Which of the following is a function of a modified histone tail?,a) Association with adjacent nucleosome,b) Interaction with DNA backbone,c) Interaction with chromodomains,d) Formation of 40-fold DNA structure,c,Explanation: Modification of histone tail generates binding sites for proteins. Specific protein domains called bromodomains and chromodomains mediate these interactions. Chromodomains containing proteins interact with methylated histone tails and are generally associated with tail specific methylating enzymes.
Question 83,6. Which of the following enzymes of transcription commonly contains a bromodomain?,a) TFIID,b) CDK,c) Pre _ RC,d) DNA polymerase,a,Explanation: Bromodomain containing proteins are involved in regulating transcription or formation of heterochromatin.

Which of the following enzymes is not correctly paired with its function?,a) Acetyl transferase _ adds acetyl group to lysine,b) Methyl transferase _ adds methyl group to serine,c) Topoisomerase _ associated with nuclear scaffold,d) Deacetylases _ removes acetyl groups from serine,b,Explanation: Methylation is an N _ terminal modification of histone tail induced by the enzyme methyl transferase. But methylation is induced in the amino acid lysine. Serine is generally involved with phosphorylation. 
Question 85,8. Which of the following is not promoted by histone tail modification?,a) Formation of repressive structures,b) Gene expression,c) Nucleosome remodeling,d) Nucleosome sliding,d,Explanation: Nucleosome sliding is a type of Nucleosome remodeling.

Question 98,9. Inverted repeat have a number of biological functions. Which of the following is a biological function of an inverted repeat?,a) Diseases,b) Central dogma,c) Cellular metabolism,d) Genetic stability,a,"Explanation: The Inverted repeat defines the region of self complementation thus can be identified by many proteins, enzymes and transposons. They also serve as sites for many mutations. Thus all of these factors may lead to alteration in the basic genome sequence. If any such alteration occurs in any vital gene it could cause genetic disorders and diseases. Example of certain disease is osteogenesis imperfecta."

For which biological phenomenon homologous recombination is critical?,a) Mitosis,b) Meiosis,c) Fragmentation,d) Sporing,b,Explanation: Homologous recombination is critical for meiosis during the pachytene stage of meiosis I. This is important for the introduction of genetic variations in every generations.
Question 751,13. What are homologs?,a) Part of DNA,b) Pair of nucleus,c) Pair of chromosomes,d) Part of a cell,c,"Explanation: Before cell division the cell has two copies of each chromosome, one of each was inherited from either parent. These are known as homologs."
Question 752,14. What is the function of the Spo11 in meiotic recombination?,a) Introduction of mutation,b) Introduction of nick,c) Introduction of DSB,d) Introduction of lesion,c,Explanation: Spo11 gene encodes a protein that introduces DSBs in chromosomal DNA to initiate meiotic recombination. The Spo11 protein cuts the DNA at many chromosomal locations with little sequence selectivity but at a very specific time during meiosis.
Question 753,15. How many subunits of Spo11 are involved in the process of cleavage of DNA?,a) 1,b) 2,c) 3,d) 4,b,Explanation: The two subunits of Spo11 cleave the DNA two nucleotides apart on the two DNA strands. It makes staggered double strand break by cleavage.
