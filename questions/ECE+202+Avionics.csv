Question Name,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer,Explanation
Question 1,1. Which of the following is true with respect to Head up display?,a) View and assimilate the flight data with his head up in a transparent display,b) Assimilate the flight data without looking at any kind of display panel,c) View and assimilate the flight data that is projected on the helmet,d) Using a head up display a pilot and view and assimilate the flight data in all 360°,a,Explanation: A major improvement in the man-machine interface is the HUD system. The major advantage in HUD is that the pilot is able to view and assimilate the important flight data parameters whilst head up and maintaining full visual concentration to the outside world. The area at which the flight parameters are displayed is only on the transparent display panel thus the pilot does not have a 360° display.
Question  2,2. Which one of the following flight parameters are not present in a typical commercial head up display?,a) Airspeed,b) Altitude,c) Heading,d) Throttle position,d,"Explanation: A typical head up display system in a commercial aircraft consists of airspeed, altimeter, heading, slip/skid indicator, turn/bank indicator, artificial horizon lining, angle of attack indicator, vertical speed indicator, flight path vector and much more depending upon the customer requirements."
Question 3,3. The main reason for using a collimated display in HUD is ________,a) More information can be displayed,b) Wide view of display,c) Information displayed is focused at infinity,d) Fast screen refresh rates,c,"Explanation: A collimated display is a display in which the rays of light emitted/reflected is parallel to the display. Since the rays of light are parallel, its focus is at infinity, thus the pilot is able to view the information on the HUD without changing his focus from the outside world scene without parallax error. Also, the ray of light from a collimated display would not disperse with distance."
Question 4,4. What are the sensors used in combination with a raster mode HUD?,a) GPS,b) LIDAR,c) Radar and FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed),d) Microwave radar,c,Explanation: In the raster mode HUD a video image of the outside world (generated from the FLIR sensors mounted in the aircraft) and the synthetic image of the outside world (generated from radar sensor) are combined to produce an enhanced vision system. The advantages of these enhanced vision system are that it enables the pilot to fly and land the aircraft in very low visibility conditions and in airports without ILS or MLS or for night flying.
Question 5,5. Which of the following is the correct order for the path of light in a HUD?,a) CRT -> mirror -> collimating lens -> combiner glass -> pilot,b) CRT -> collimating lens -> mirror -> combiner glass -> pilot,c) CRT -> mirror -> combiner glass -> collimating lens -> pilot,d) Collimating lens -> CRT -> mirror -> combiner glass -> pilot,a,Explanation: The symbols and flight parameters are generated and magnified by the CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and is reflected almost 90° by a mirror. The reflected rays are passed through a collimating lens which produces a parallel ray of light with focus at infinity. The collimated rays are then displayed in a combiner glass which combines the outside world picture with the flight parameters generated to be viewed by the pilot.
Question 6,"7. What is the IFOV for a collimating lens of diameter 100mm, the distance between the collimating lens and combiner glass=50mm, the distance between pilot eyes and combiner glass=400mm?",a) 25.0°,b) 12.6°,c) 28.0°,d) 14.2°,b,"Explanation: D=100mm, L=50+400 =450mm (Since L is the distance from the observer to the collimating lens)IFOV = 2 x tan-1 (D/2L) =2 x tan-1( 100/2_450) = 12.6803° ≈ 12.6°"
Question 7,8. Which of the following are not controlled by the HUD processor?,a) Power supply to HUD,b) Brightness level and contrast level,c) Symbol and font generation,d) Computing flight parameters,d,"Explanation: The flight parameters are computed by the air data computer. The various controls and functions carried out by the HUD processor are display formats, axis conversion, parameter conversion, format management, brightness and contrast control, power supply and calibration."
Question 8,9. What is the contrast ratio of real world image to the CRT display image?,a) 1:1,b) 4:1,c) 7:3,d) 2:1,c,Explanation: A combiner allows 70% of the outside world light and 30% of the CRT produced collimated light to pass through it. Thus contrast ration= brightness of real-world light : brightness of CRT light = 70 : 30 = 7 : 3 .
Question 9,10. What is the reason for using CRT used instead of LCD or LED displays?,a) To meet the required brightness level,b) Cheap to manufacture,c) Low energy of operation,d) Lightweight,a,"Explanation: To clearly see the flight parameters displayed on the combiner glass against the bright sky, it is necessary to achieve a display brightness of 30,000 Cd/m2. This high brightness requirement is the reason why CRT is used instead of LCD or LED, even though CRT’s are heavier and require more power to run."
Question 10,1. Which of the following is not true with respect to HMD (Helmet Mounted Display)?,a) The flight parameters are displayed in the visor of the helmet,b) HMD comprises of collimated display,c) Using HMD the pilot has a FOV (Field OF Vision) of 360° without moving his head,d) The flight parameters are displayed in the pilot’s line of sight,c,Explanation: The FOV of an HMD is 360° in the sense that the pilot can look around(by moving his head) in all direction and still view the flight parameters in his line of sight. If the pilot does not move his head the FOV the HMD provides ranges from35° to 50° depending upon the type of aircraft and its role. 
Question 11,2. Which one of the following is not an essential factor in integrating the HMD with the helmet?,a) Must not interfere with the oxygen mask,b) Protect eyes and head during high-speed ejection,c) Geometry of the cockpit,d) Overall minimum weight for comfort,c,"Explanation: The geometry of the cockpit does not affect the HMD nor the helmet as the helmet is worn by the pilot and the FOV of the HMD moves with the pilot’s head. Some of the factors that are essential are the minimum weight for comfort while wearing the helmet for long flight hours and in high g maneuvers, crashworthiness of the helmet with HMD and communication systems integrated no interference with other objects in the cockpit such as oxygen mask as it is crucial at ejection at high speeds."
Question 12,3. What is the weight the pilot will feel on his head while executing a 9g maneuver with an HMD helmet of weight 800g?,a) 7.2kg,b) 0.72kg,c) 70.06kg,d) 9kg,a,"Explanation: 800grams = 0.8 kg, during a 9g turn the pilot will experience a gravitational force 9 times that of a normal person at Earth surface. The total weight felt by the pilot = 0.8 x 9 = 7.2kg. Typical HMD helmets weigh around 1kg and at 9g the weight felt by the pilot will be 9kg which is just acceptable."
Question 13,4. Which does not affect the inertial forces felt by the pilot when accelerating or decelerating?,a) Positioning CG with the pivoting point of the head,b) Reduce the weight of the helmet,c) Keeping the head in the upright position,d) Reduce the moment of inertia about yaw and pitch axis,c,Explanation: Keeping the head always in an upright position is not an option for pilots since the pilot will lose situational awareness if he does so. The pilot will feel the inertial forces irrespective of his head position. By reducing the moment of inertia we can reduce the inertial torques experienced. Reducing weight and positioning the CG of the helmet with the pivoting point of head ensures that there are minimal out of balance moments. 
Question 14,5. What are the advantages of HMS (Helmet Mounted Sights) over HMD?,a) Display flight data in the pilot’s line of sight,b) Provide target locking capabilities by looking at the target,c) Provide a FOV of 360°,d) Provide enhanced vision by combining radar and FLIR,b,Explanation: A Helmet Mounted Sights in combination with a head tracker system provides effective means for the pilot to lock on to target. The pilot can look at the enemy aircraft and lock on to it. The relative position of the enemy is then calculated by the head position of the pilot and sent to missiles to engage the target. A typical seeker head needs to be pointed to within about 2° of the target to achieve an automatic lock on.
Question 15,6. Monocular rivalry occurs due to the brain trying to concentrate on _________,a) two equal displays on both the eyes,b) two different displays on both the eyes,c) one eye with display and the other eye without display,d) both the outside world image and the displayed image in one eye,c,Explanation: Monocular rivalry occurs because the brain is trying to process different images from each eye and rivalry can occur between the eye with a display and the eye without a display. The effect is most significant when flying at night when one eye sees less light whereas the other eye sees more. To overcome this binocular system is used where both the eyes are presented with the flight parameters.
Question 16,7. Why are IIT (Image Intensifier Tubes) used in HMD?,a) Clarity of outside world scene,b) Provide night vision capabilities,c) Terrain mapping,d) Compensation for parallax errors,b,Explanation: IIT is an image intensification device which complements the infrared viewing system by providing night vision. The image form the Image Intensifier Tube is a phosphor screen which emits green light in the centre of the visual band where the eye is most sensitive.
Question 17,8. In what type of display is the image projected directly to the retina of the pilot?,a) Virtual reality display,b) Binocular HMD,c) God’s eye view display,d) Optical display,a,"Explanation: Virtual reality displays are for future virtual cockpits where the image is directly projected onto the retina of the pilot by a raster scanned laser light beam. The current technology of implementing a virtual retinal display involves lasers, optical fibers and miniature vibrating mirrors for raster scanning the retina of the eye, together with coupling optics."
Question 18,9. Which of the following does not provide a proper reason for not using HMD in civil aircraft?,a) No need of helmets in civil aircraft,b) Acoustic noise level in civil aircrafts is much lower,c) Situational awareness is needed in civil aircraft,d) An oxygen mask is required only in the case of cabin depressurization,c,"Explanation: For a civil aircraft the situational awareness is not essential as they are inherently safer and do not execute high g maneuvers. Also, situational awareness is an important factor only when the flight parameters are rapidly changing, for a civil aircraft which is in steady level flight for most of its flight time situational awareness is not necessary.  "
Question 19,1. What are the four electromechanical devices retained while making an avionics update for old aircraft?,"a) Vertical speed indicator, airspeed indicator, artificial horizon and heading indicator","b) Altimeter, airspeed indicator, artificial horizon and angle of attack indicator","c) Altimeter, airspeed indicator, turns coordinator and heading indicator","d) Altimeter, airspeed indicator, artificial horizon and heading indicator",d,"Explanation: Avionics update is one of the effective ways to extend the life of an aircraft. The technology is undergoing an exponential growth and is hence viable to use multifunctional CRT displays in places of mechanical dials. However, the basic T instruments, the altimeter, airspeed indicator, artificial horizon and heading indicator are retained because of their importance in flight control. In modern cockpits, even these are being replaced by solid-state devices with LCD display."
Question 20,2. OLED display is better than LED because ________,a) They are cheaper,b) They have high brightness,c) Do not require any illuminating source,d) Easy to manufacture,c,Explanation: OLED displays have numerous advantages over the LED display in the aviation industry. They have a high resolution and are super thin flat panel which can even be curved. It is an emissive display and thus do not require any backlighting. This obviously reduces weight and is optimal for the aviation industry.
Question 21,"3. What are the 5 primary mechanical displays, a Primary Flight Display (PFD) can replace?","a) Altimeter, turn coordinator, vertical speed indicator, artificial horizon and heading/compass indicator","b) Altimeter, vertical speed indicator, artificial horizon, heading/compass indicator and Mach meter","c) Altimeter, vertical speed indicator, artificial horizon, heading/compass indicator and landing gear position","d) Altimeter, turn coordinator, artificial horizon, heading/compass indicator and Mach meter",b,"Explanation: The instruments that are replaced by the PFD are the basic instruments necessary to fly an aircraft. These instruments are altimeter, vertical speed indicator, artificial horizon, heading/compass indicator and Mach meter. All the primary information is shown in the PFD so that the pilot does not have to scan for information."
Question 22,4. Why are mechanical instruments retained when high tech LED displays are available?,a) LED displays are costly,b) LED Displays cannot withstand the flight environment conditions,c) Probability of failure,d) Accuracy,c,Explanation: Although high tech LED Displays are available the mechanical systems are still used as a fail-safe for the LED display. There is always a chance of electrical failure due to engine failure and power supply may be cut off. In situations like this mechanical systems are necessary to land the plane safely.
Question 23,5. Which of the following is false with respect to multi-function LCD displays in cockpits?,a) High resolution,b) More information to be displayed,c) Bigger and customizable display,d) Take more space in cockpits,d,"Explanation: In a typical fighter aircraft there are hundreds of flight parameters and focus cannot be given to all of them. In a dial gauge cockpit, the pilot has to keep track of all the parameters by looking into various gauges which are quite confusing and arises a lot of man-made error. To overcome this problem LED/LCD displays are used which are bigger in size for the same weight and customizable. They also take up a lesser place in the cockpit as they are super thin and flat."
Question 24,6. How many Primary Flight Displays are present in typical civil aircraft cockpit?,a) 1,b) 2,c) 4,d) 3,b,"Explanation: A typical civil aircraft cockpit will have 4 displays, 2 Primary Flight Displays, and 2 Multi-Functional Displays. The 2 PFDs are duplicated (i.e; they display the exact same information) one for the pilot and one for the co-pilot. The other two displays can be chosen what to show either by the pilot or the copilot."
Question 25,7. Which one of the following is false with respect to electromechanical instruments?,a) High cost,b) Require skilled labor for repair,c) Accurate measurements,d) Inevitable wear,c,"Explanation: Although electromechanical instruments have been used for a long period of time, the cost of ownership of such instrument is high. These also depend on very low friction precision mechanisms which require skilled labor for repair. Since they have rotating components in them they have inevitable wear and deterioration in the spin axis bearing system. Due to this, their measurements may not be accurate with time."
Question 26,8. What are the standby instruments that are combined in a Solid state integrated standby instrument?,"a) Altimeter, vertical speed indicator, artificial horizon","b) Altimeter, airspeed indicator","c) Altimeter, airspeed indicator, artificial horizon","d) Altimeter, turn coordinator, artificial horizon, heading/compass indicator and Mach meter",c,"Explanation: The standby attitude indicator, standby altimeter, and standby airspeed indicator are replaced with a single solid-state integrated standby instrument system packaged in a 3 ATI case. They consist of solid-state gyros and accelerometers, solid-state pressure sensors along with a microprocessor and color AMLCD."
Question 27,9. What is the operating voltage of Solid-state integrated standby instrument?,a) 11V DC,b) 28V DC,c) 5V DC,d) 115V DC,b,Explanation: The Solid-state integrated standby instrument operates from the 28V DC supply produced by the emergency batteries. The integral power conditioning electronics are designed to cope with the variations in the battery supply voltage.
Question 28,1. What type of beams are used for the tactical control panel?,a) Matrix array of infrared beams,b) Light beams,c) Lasers,d) Microwave beams,a,Explanation: A typical tactical control panel uses a matrix of infrared beams across the surface of the display containing various functional keys. Touching a specific function key on the display surface interrupts the x and y infrared beams which intersect over the displayed key function and hence signal the operation of that particular key function.
Question 29,2. What is DVI control?,a) Direct voice input,b) Digitally vectored input,c) Digital voice input,d) Direct vectored input,a,Explanation: DVI control is direct voice input control through which the pilot can enter flight and navigational commands through voice.
Question 30,"3. In a DVI control, which system recognizes the pilot’s control?",a) Flight data computer,b) Air Data Computer,c) Speech recognition system,d) Central command center,c,Explanation: The commands given by the pilot is recognized by a speech recognition system which compares the spoken audio with preloaded vocabulary templates. If the command is recognized indication is given either aurally or visually to confirm the command.
Question 31,4. The main reason for DVI control system in aircraft is _____________,a) less weight,b) latest technology,c) reduce pilot work load,d) space constraints,c,"Explanation: DVI control system is used to control the aircraft using voice commands, thus the pilot need not have to operate push buttons, switches. This reduces the workload on the pilot during heavy workload operations such as combat."
Question 32,5. What are isolated word recognizers?,a) Systems that can recognize anyone’s voice,b) System that is not fully voice commanded,c) Systems that require a pause between each word to recognize,d) Systems that only accept one-word command,c,Explanation: An isolated word recognizer requires pauses between each word said as it cannot recognize fully connected speech. The DVI control in an aircraft must not be an isolated voice recognizer to ensure smooth man-machine interface.
Question 33,7. What is the reason for using speech synthesizers in aircrafts?,a) Communication with ATC,b) Communication with another aircraft,c) Used in flight data recorder,d) Warning messages to pilot,d,Explanation: Speech synthesizers are used to provide voiced warning messages to the pilot of system malfunctions and failures.

Question 36,10. Why is the stereo sound warning system used?,a) Better sound clarity,b) Warning sound from the actual direction of a threat,c) To cancel the heavy background noise,d) To hear sound external to the aircraft,b,"Explanation: A stereo sound warning system is used to produce a warning signal with the direction of threat. It consists of speakers mounted all around the cockpit, if the threat is approaching from the left side, the speakers on the left side produce signals to warn the pilot."
Question 37,1. Why is the BFW system used?,a) To control aerodynamically efficient but unstable body,b) For communications in aircraft,c) Better navigation,d) Reduced chances of enemy detection,a,Explanation: The literal meaning of Fly By wire system is flying by wires(I.e; electrically). One of the main advantages of using FBW is to exploit increased aerodynamic shapes at the cost of stability. The FBW system provides high integrity automatic stabilization to compensate for the loss of stability and provide overall better performance.
Question 38,2. How is fly by wire system implemented in an aircraft?,a) By using control rods and linkages connecting stick to control surfaces,b) By using high power radio transmitters and receivers,c) By using computers and actuators to control surfaces,d) Artificial intelligence,c,Explanation: The fly by wire system uses actuators to move the control surfaces to maintain the stability of an aircraft. The signals sent by the pilot via the control stick is intercepted by the flight controller computer and signals are sent to the respective actuators to move the control surfaces.
Question 39,3. Which one of the following is not true with respect to the FBW system?,a) FBW is not necessary for every aircraft,b) FBW makes an aircraft stealthy,c) FBW provides better control and carefree flying,d) FBW makes aircraft with low stability fly smoothly,b,"Explanation: The FBW system need not necessarily provide stealth to an aircraft. It provides control, stability and carefree flying in aircraft with low natural stability. Typically stealthy aircraft design is mainly focused on stealth and has very less stability, here FBW provides good handling and control characteristics to fly the aircraft without FBW system."
Question 40,4. Which of the following is not a component of the FBW system?,a) Flight control computer,b) Aircraft motion sensor,c) Actuators,d) Communication receivers,d,"Explanation: The fly by wire system consists of control stick (input by the pilot), Flight control computer(processing unit), actuator control electronics(signal to actuators), actuator(movement of control surfaces). Communication systems are completely independent of FBW systems."
Question 41,6. How are FBW signals transmitted?,a) Simplex,b) Duplex,c) Time division multiplexing,d) Code division multiplexing,c,"Explanation: Transmission of electric signals is a key element in a FBW system. Faster the signal transmission, quicker the response of the aircraft to the pilot stick controls. Time division multiplexing is used where signals can be transmitted along a network comprising only of two wires as only one set of data is being transmitted at any particular time."

It has a data rate of 1Mbit/sec and a word length of 20 bits to encode clock, data, and address and so can receive or transmit up to 50,000 data words a second."
Question 43,8. What type of cable is used in ARINC 629?,a) Coaxial cable,b) Screened twisted pair,c) Unscreened twisted pair,d) Parallel lines,c,Explanation: The ARINC 629 links and bus uses an unscreened twisted pair of wires with a connection to the bus through demountable current transformer couplers. Mil STD 1553 uses screened twisted pair cables. Parallel lines are rarely used today.
Question 44,9. Why are actuators used in FBW systems?,a) Movement of control surfaces,b) Reduce drag,c) Increase lift,d) Safety equipment,a,"Explanation: Unlike traditional aircraft, FBW system uses electrical signals to operate the actuators which in turn move the control surface in place of mechanical linkages and control rods directly connecting the pilot’s stick to the control surfaces."
Question 45,10. Why are both electrical and hydraulic systems are used in the same aircraft?,a) To generate more force,b) Quick deflections,c) As a fail safe,d) Hydraulics for more force and electric for quick deflections,c,"Explanation: Most of the main actuators are electro-hydraulic, fully electric actuators are used as a fail safe for hydraulic actuators. They must be able to survive any two failures and carry on operating satisfactorily in order to meet the aircraft safety and integrity requirements."
Question 46,11. The reason for using quadruplex actuation system is _______,a) precise movement,b) to counteract heavy air loads on the control surfaces,c) quick reaction to the control stick movement,d) as a fail safe mechanism,d,Explanation: A quadruplex actuation system consists of four independent actuators whose output drives the power control unit.

Question 47,"12. In a typical quadruplex actuator system, how is the failure of an actuator identified?",a) By comparing it with the signal of the three good ones,b) By comparing it with a simulation model,c) Using in-lane fault detection,d) Using reflectometry,a,Explanation: A typical quadruplex system uses signal processing based FDI( Fault Detection and Isolation) system. It identifies the failed actuator by comparing its control signal with the other three good ones. A model-based FDI system is generally used in triplex architecture.
Question 48,1. What type of system is classified as “Direct electric link system”?,a) Systems with parallel wire connection,b) System with serial wire connection,c) System with motion sensor feedback,d) System without motion sensor feedback,d,"Explanation: A FBW system by definition has to have a motion feedback system. Without these, the system is considered as “Direct electric system”. The information from these sensors is used to automatically stabilize the aircraft."
Question 49,2. What does FBW use to scale the control surface deflection according to the aircraft’s airspeed and height?,a) Air Data Computer,b) Flight Management System,c) Flight Control Computer,d) Autopilot system,a,"Explanation: FBW uses an Air Data System to scale the control surface deflection according to the aircraft’s airspeed and height variations. The need for air data information on the airspeed and height is to compensate for the very wide variation in the control surface effectiveness over the aircraft’s flight envelope of height and speed combinations. The Air Data Computer provides various information available from the airstream such as airspeed, altitude, and angle of attack."
Question 50,3. What is the incidence angle in the yaw plane called?,a) Side slip angle,b) Yaw angle,c) Crossflow angle,d) Angle of crosswind,a,Explanation: The angle of incidence in the yaw plane is known as the side slip angle. It is the angle between the direction the aircraft is travelling and the direction its nose is pointing. When the side slip angle is high the aircraft is not in a coordinated turn and hence is flying inefficiently.
Question 51,4. Why does an FBW system use a smaller tail area?,a) Bigger tails are harder to move as they produce larger wing loads,b) Actively controls the tail thus making up for the reduced stability due to lesser area,c) Tail does not contribute much to stability and its area can thus be reduced effectively,d) To reduce weight and drag but at a cost of natural stability,d,"Explanation: The reason for using reduced tail area is to reduce weight, drag and to increase overall performance, But at a cost of reduced natural stability. A FBW makes up for the reduced stability by actively controlling the tailplane and rudder using accurate motion feedback sensors and actuators."
Question 52,5. An aircraft is negatively stable when ______,a) its tailplane produces negative lift (downwards),b) its tailplane produces positive lift (upwards),c) its tailplane does not produce lift,d) it is flying inverted,b,"Explanation: An aircraft is said to be negatively stable when its tailplane produces positivelift. The tail of an aircraft without an FBW system must always produce negative lift to maintain stability and to keep the nose up. Since it produces negative lift, it actually acts in the direction of weight reducing aerodynamic efficiency. In an FBW equipped aircraft a positive lift producing tail can be used by using flight control computers and motion sensors to main stability at all times."
Question 53,7. A FBW control stick is referred as _______,a) FBW joystick,b) FBW control pad,c) FBW inceptor,d) FBW analog stick,c,Explanation: A FBW control stick is referred to as FBW inceptor. An inceptor by definition is a device that converts the pilot’s control inputs into electrical signals. There are two types of inceptors- active and passive.  
Question 54,8. Why are dampers an essential element in FBW inceptors?,a) Control aircraft stability by damping forces,b) Acts as a low pass filter on the stick movement,c) Provides accurate deflections,d) To prevent aircraft to carry out critical maneuvers,b,"Explanation: Without the damper, the stick would be considerably under damped because of the low friction in the mechanism and the significant mass of the hand grip. It provides a smooth feel to the stick movement; the spring–mass–damper combination acting as a low pass filter on the stick movement. These characteristics are carefully tailored to meet the consensus of pilot approval."
Question 55,10. What is the relation between autopilot and FBW?,"a) FBW provides autopilot commands for roll, pitch, and yaw","b) Autopilot provides FBW commands of roll, pitch, and yaw",c) Autopilot is a part of FBW system,d) Autopilot is not related to FBW,b,"Explanation: The autopilot is like an artificial pilot system which flies the aircraft under a set of constraints. It provides steering commands such as roll, pitch and yaw rates to the FBW system. FBW system ensures that response to the autopilot commands is fast and well damped, providing smooth control of aircraft in autopilot modes."
Question 56,12. Why is FBW essential in stealth aircraft?,a) FBW system damps radar energy,b) Improves control,c) Reduces engine noise,d) Disturbs tracking techniques used by missiles,b,"Explanation: Stealth configurations and requirements can conflict with aerodynamics requirements and FBW flight control is essential to give acceptable control and safe handling across the flight envelope. An example of such is the American fighter F -117, nicknamed “Nighthawk”. It is almost impossible to fly this aircraft without feedback FBW system."
Question 57,1. What are control laws?,a) Algorithms relating pilots stick and control surface,b) Laws that govern aerodynamics forces,c) Laws that govern flight motion,d) Laws used to predict range and endurance,a,"Explanation: The term ‘control laws’ is used to define the algorithms relating the control surface demand to the pilot’s stick command and the various motion sensor signals and the aircraft height, speed and Mach number."
Question 58,2. What is _i in pitch rate command law?,a) Tailplane demand angle,b) Pilot input angle,c) Gain in loop,d) Pitch rate gearing,b,"Explanation: Pitch rate command law is given by _D = K(_i _ Gqq) where _D is the tailplane demand angle; _i is the pilot’s input command; q is the pitch rate; K is the forward loop gain, and Gq is the pitch rate gearing."
Question 59,3. What is false true with respect to K in the pitch rate command law?,a) Value of K is infinite,b) Value of K is constant with height and altitude,c) Value of K changes with height and altitude,d) Value of k is constant with altitude and airspeed,d,"Explanation: As the altitude and airspeed are varied, the magnitude of hinge moment in the control surface varies. This raises the need to vary gain K with change in flight conditions."
Question 60,4. Derivative of a control system provides _________,a) Low steady state error,b) Gain proportional to error,c) Reduced overshoot,d) Infinite gain,c,"Explanation: Derivative of error control provides a phase advance characteristic tocompensate for the lags in the system, for instance, actuator response, and hence improve the loop stability. This increases the damping of the aircraft response and reduces the overshoot to a minimum when responding to an input or disturbance. "
Question 61,5. Integral of a control system provides __________,a) Low steady state error,b) Gain proportional to error,c) Reduced overshoot,d) infinite gain,a,Explanation: Integral of error control eliminates steady-state errors and reduces the following lag. The integral of error term increases the loop gain at low frequencies up to theoretically infinite gain at dc so that there are zero steady-state errors due to out of trim external moments or forces acting on the aircraft.
Question 62,6. Phase advance control is also known as __________,a) Proportional error controller,b) Derivative error controller,c) Integral error controller,d) One plus derivative error controller,d,"Explanation: A phase advance controller is usually known as phase advance controller with a transfer function.The control term is filtered to limit the increase in gain at high frequencies and smooth the differentiation process which amplifies any noise present in the error signal."
Question 63,7. What is the MTBF of a solid state rate gyro?,"a) 1,000 to 5,000 hrs","b) 5,000 to 10,000 hrs","c) 10,000 to 50,000 hrs","d) 50,000 to 100,000 hrs",d,"Explanation: Solid state rate gyros are very reliable sensors with an MTBF in the region of 50,000 to 100,000 hours – ‘fit and forget’ devices.

The original analog signal is recovered by passing it through a low-pass filter. In TDM using PAM, a circuit called a multiplexer (MUX or MPX) samples multiple analog signal sources; the resulting pulses are interleaved and then transmitted over a single channel."
Question 382,4. Which of the following device was used in early TDM/PAM telemetry systems?,a) Commuter,b) Linear switch,c) Logic gates,d) DSP,a,Explanation: Multiplexers in early TDM/PAM telemetry systems used a form of rotary switch known as a commutator.

The overall length of the antenna is 0.73_ or 0.73(984)/f = 718.32/f. This is longer than the traditional one-half wavelength of a dipole antenna, but the physical shape changes the necessary dimensions for resonance."
Question 460,5. The radiation pattern of a half-wave dipole has the shape of a ______,a) Doughnut,b) Sphere,c) Hemisphere,d) Circular,a,Explanation: The radiation pattern of any antenna is the shape of the electromagnetic energy radiated from or received by that antenna.

The maximum amplitude of the pattern occurs at 0° and 180°. The 3-dB down points are 70.7 percent of the maximum. The angle formed with two lines extending from the center of the curve to these 3-dB points is the beam width. The beam width is 90°. The smaller the beam width angle, the more directional the antenna."
Question 462,7. What does the beam width of an antenna tell us?,a) Signal strength,b) Signal power,c) Directivity,d) Degradation,c,"Explanation: The measure of an antenna’s directivity is beam width, the angle of the radiation pattern over which a transmitter’s energy is directed or received.

What is the radiation pattern of an isotropic radiator?,a) Doughnut,b) Sphere,c) Hemisphere,d) Circular,b,"Explanation: An isotropic radiator is a theoretical point source of electromagnetic energy. The E and H fields radiate out in all directions from the point source, and at any given distance from the point source, the fields form a sphere."
Question 465,10. What is the impedance of the folded dipole antenna?,a) 50Ω,b) 100Ω,c) 300Ω,d) 20Ω,c,"Explanation: A popular variation of the half-wave dipole is the folded dipole. Like the standard dipole, it is one-half wavelength long. However, it consists of two parallel conductors connected at the ends with one side open at the center for connection to the transmission line. The impedance of this popular antenna is 300 V, making it an excellent match for the widely available 300-V twin lead."

Question 467,1. What is the use of loading coil?,a) Correcting resonance to a desired frequency,b) Increasing the antenna gain,c) Sideband suppression,d) Increasing the range of the antenna,a,"Explanation: When a vertical antenna is made less than one-quarter wavelength, the practical effect is a decreased inductance. The antenna no longer resonates at the desired operating frequency, but at a higher frequency. To compensate for this, a series inductor, called a loading coil, is connected in series with the antenna coil. The loading coil brings the antenna back into resonance at the desired frequency."
Question 468,2. Why is top hat added to antennas?,a) To increase capacitance,b) Increasing the antenna gain,c) Sideband suppression,d) Increasing the range of the antenna,a,"Explanation: A top hat is a structure that increases the capacitance to surrounding items, bringing the antenna back into resonance.

Circles and ellipses are geometric figures that can be accurately described mathematically. Because the orbit is either circular or elliptical, it is possible to calculate the position of a satellite at any given time."
Question 476,4. The direction of orbit in the same direction of earth rotation is called ______,a) Retrograde,b) Posigrade,c) Perigee,d) Apogee,b,"Explanation: The direction of satellite rotation may be either in the same direction as the earth’s rotation or against the direction of earth’s rotation.

Naturally, the synodic and sidereal periods differ from each other because of the earth’s rotation."
Question 480,9. What is the angle of inclination for a satellite following an equatorial orbit?,a) 0°,b) 180°,c) 45°,d) 90°,a,"Explanation: Another definition of inclination is the angle between the equatorial plane and the satellite orbital plane as the satellite enters the northern hemisphere. When the angle of inclination is 0°, the satellite is directly above the equator. Orbits with 0° inclination are generally called equatorial orbits."

The angle between the line from the earth station’s antenna to the satellite and the line between the earth station’s antenna and the earth’s horizon is called as ___________,a) Angle of inclination,b) Angle of elevation,c) Apogee angle,d) LOS angle,b,"Explanation: The angle of elevation of a satellite is the angle that appears between the line from the earth station’s antenna to the satellite and the line between the earth station’s antenna and the earth’s horizon. If the angle of elevation is too small, the signals between the earth station and the satellite have to pass through much more of the earth’s atmosphere. Because of the very low powers used and the high absorption of the earth’s atmosphere."
Question 482,11. To use a satellite for communication relay or repeater purposes what type of orbit will be the best?,a) Circular orbit,b) Elliptical orbit,c) Geosynchronous orbit,d) Triangular orbit,c,"Explanation: The best solution is to launch a synchronous or geostationary satellite.

The transmitting station sends the information to the satellite, which in turn re-transmits it to the receiving stations."
Question 486,2. The transmitter-receiver combination in the satellite is known as a _______,a) Relay,b) Repeater,c) Transponder,d) Duplexer,c,Explanation: The transmitter-receiver combination in the satellite is known as a transponder.

Question 489,6. What is the reason for shifting from c band to ku band in satellite communication?,a) Lesser attenuation,b) Less power requirements,c) More bandwidth,d) Overcrowding,d,"Explanation: Most new communication satellites will operate in the Ku band. This upward shift in frequency is happening because the C band is overcrowded. Many communication satellites are in orbit now, most of them operating in the C band. However, there is some difficulty with interference because of the heavy usage. The only way this interference will be minimized is to shift all future satellite communication to higher frequencies. "
Question 490,7. Which of the following bands cannot be used for satellite communication?,a) MF,b) Ku,c) X,d) C,a,"Explanation: MF is a lower frequency band than Ku, C and X bands and does not lie in the microwave spectrum.

Question 492,9. Why are techniques like frequency reuse and spatial isolation carried out?,a) Reduce traffic load,b) More gain,c) High speed,d) Error detection,a,"Explanation: at times there is more traffic than there are transponders to handle it.

Two of these techniques are known as frequency reuse and spatial isolation."
Question 493,10. Which technique uses two different antennas to reduce traffic on the same frequency?,a) Spatial isolation,b) Frequency reuse,c) Multiplexing,d) Modulation,b,"Explanation: In the frequency reuse technique two systems use the same frequency, although operating on exactly the same frequencies, they are isolated from each other by the use of special antenna techniques. For example, a vertically polarized antenna will not respond to a horizontally polarized signal and vice versa. Or a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) antenna will not respond to a right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) signal and vice versa."
Question 494,11. Which technique uses spot beam antennas to divide the area covered by the satellite into smaller segments?,a) Spatial isolation,b) Frequency reuse,c) Multiplexing,d) Modulation,a,"Explanation: By using narrow beam or spot beam antennas, the area on the earth covered by the satellite can be divided up into smaller segments. Earth stations in each segment may actually use the same frequency, but because of the very narrow beam widths of the antennas, there is no interference between adjacent segments."
Question 495,1. Which of the following is not a satellite subsystem?,a) Ground station,b) Power system,c) Telemetry tracking,d) Communication subsystem,a,"Explanation: The communication subsystem is the most important part of the satellite.

Question 498,"4. Which of the following components receives, translates the signal frequency and re-transmits the signal in a satellite?",a) Repeater,b) Relay,c) Transponder,d) Transducer,c,"Explanation: The uplink signals from earth are amplified, translated in frequency, and re-transmitted on the downlink to one or more earth stations. The component that performs this function is known as a transponder."
Question 499,5. Why is there a huge spectrum space between the transmitted and received signal in satellite communication?,a) Reduce interference,b) Maximum efficiency,c) Less attenuation,d) To reduce space occupied by filters,a,"Explanation: Because of the close proximity of the transmitter and the receiver in the satellite, the high transmitter output power for the downlink is picked up by that satellite receiver. Naturally, the uplink signal is totally obliterated. Furthermore, the transmitter output fed back into the receiver input causes oscillation. To avoid this problem, the receiver and transmitter in the satellite transponder are designed to operate at separate frequencies. In this way, they will not interfere with each other."
Question 500,6. Which of the following transponders convert the uplink signal to downlink signal using two mixers,a) Single conversion transponders,b) Dual conversion transponders,c) Regenerative transponders,d) Dual mixer transponder,b,Explanation: A dual-conversion transponder makes the frequency translation in two steps with two mixers.

Question 502,9. Why is it not possible to provide transmit function by wideband amplifier and mixer circuits?,a) Heavy attenuation,b) High power output over wideband is not possible,c) Economically not profitable,d) Weight of the system increases five fold,b,Explanation: it is generally not possible to generate very high output power over such wide bandwidth. The fact is that no components and circuits can do this well. The high-power amplifiers in most transponders are traveling-wave tubes that inherently have limited bandwidth. They operate well over a small range but cannot deal with the entire 500-MHz bandwidth allocated to a satellite.
Question 503,10. Which of the following is not true?,a) Battery is only used as a back up,"b) When in orbit, solar power is always available",c) Battery is used for initial satellite orientation and stabilization,d) The batteries are charged using solar power,b,"Explanation: When a satellite goes into an eclipse or when the solar panels are not properly positioned, there is a temporary cut in solar power supply. In situations like this the batteries take over temporarily and keep the satellite operating. The batteries are not large enough to power the satellite for a long time; they are used as a backup system for eclipses, initial satellite orientation and stabilization, or emergency conditions."
Question 504,1. What is the use of the band pass filter in the receiver section?,a) Protects the receiver,b) Increases antenna gain,c) Reduces noise,d) To reduce it to an intermediate frequency,a,Explanation: The diplexer feeds a bandpass filter (BPF) in the receiver section that ensures that only the received frequencies pass through to the sensitive receiving circuits. This bandpass filter blocks the high-power transmit a signal that can occur simultaneously with reception. This prevents overload and damage to the receiver.
Question 505,"3. In Rf tuning, what is the first local oscillator?",a) Quartz oscillator,b) Frequency synthesizer,c) Magnetic oscillator,d) Electric oscillators,b,"Explanation: In RF tuning, the first local oscillator is made adjustable.

Question 833,13. Which mode of the secondary radar gives only altitude?,a) Mode A,b) Mode B,c) Mode C,d) Mode S,a,Explanation: There are two types of interrogations in the ATCRBS: mode A and mode C. Mode A provides identity only and mode C provides identity and altitude of the aircraft. 
Question 834,14. The undesirable responses from buildings and clouds for the radar pulse are called as __________,a) Noise,b) Disturbance,c) Clutter,d) Radio error,c,Explanation: The primary radar pulse is reflected by buildings and clouds and cause undesirable effects in the actual identification. These are called as clutter and can be eliminated by combing primary radar with secondary radar.
Question 835,15. What is the time separation for P1 and P3 for mode A secondary radar?,a) 8 _s,b) 21 _s,c) 6 _s,d) 4 _s,a,"Explanation: The time delay between P1 and P3 determines the type of interrogation. When the Time lag is 8_s, it corresponds to mode A whereas a separation of 21 _s corresponds to mode C."
Question 836,1. How does mode S system differ from mode A and C?,a) Extension of secondary radar,b) Uses pulse technology,c) More data can be transferred,d) One way travel of radio signal,c,"Explanation: The mode S system works similar to that of mode A and mode C system and causes a transponder to reply when its identity is not known. In a mode S system, additional data other than just altitude and identity can be provided in the MTI."
Question 837,2. What is the frequency of interrogation pulse in secondary radar?,a) 1020 MHz,b) 1300 MHz,c) 1030 MHz,d) 1500 MHz,c,"Explanation: The interrogation pulse is transmitted at 1030 MHz and the reply pulse by the aircraft transponder is given at 1090 MHz. Since the reply is coded information, it does not interfere with other transponders that are using the same frequency."
Question 838,3. Which mode is used for selective calling?,a) Mode A,b) Mode B,c) Mode C,d) Mode S,d,"Explanation: Different modes have its own unique features; mode A gives only identity, mode c gives identity and altitude, mode B is used in European operations and mode S is used for selective calling of transponders."
Question 839,4. What are the numbers of non-selective interrogations in mode S system?,a) 5,b) 6,c) 7,d) 8,b,Explanation: Mode S interrogations are divided into two types: selective and non-selective. The non-selective are the simplest and include familiar techniques. There is a total of 6 non-selective interrogations.
Question 840,5. How does mode S identify each aircraft?,a) Unique code for each transponder,b) Lapsed time,c) RCS,d) Directly talking to the pilot,a,"Explanation: Unlike the ATCRBS where a squawk code is dialed into the transponder, a mode S transponder has a unique identity permanently assigned to it. The mode S radar system can have more than 16 million different identities, enough for each airplane in the world to have a unique identity."
Question 841,6. The error caused by two aircraft flying close to each other replying to the same interrogation pulse is called ______,a) Garble,b) Fruit,c) Noise,d) Interference,a,Explanation: If several aircraft are within the range of the secondary radar and reply to the same interrogation pulse there is a chance that two reply pulses can overlap each other and cause an error in the values of interfere with different aircraft.
Question 842,7. Transmission of modes reply at regular interval to aid TACS is called ________,a) Garble,b) Squitter,c) Fruit,d) Pulsed Radar,b,"Explanation: An important transponder characteristic that aids TCAS is the transmission of a mode S reply at quasi-random intervals of about 1 sec, which is called squitter."
Question 843,1. The time between the collision of two aircraft on a collision course is called _____,a) Differential time,b) Tau,c) Traffic time,d) Collision time,b,Explanation: Tau is the range of the other aircraft with respect to an aircraft divided by range rate. Range divided by range rate is time-essentially the time that would elapse before a collision.
Question 844,2. What does the threshold number for Tau depend on?,a) Speed of the aircraft,b) Size of the aircraft,c) Experience of the pilots,d) Maneuverability of the aircraft,d,"Explanation: the threshold number for Tau, whether it is 10 sec or 100 sec depends on the ability of the aircraft to maneuver and avoid a collision."
Question 845,3. What is the surveillance range of a general TCAS system?,a) 30 sec,b) 20 min,c) 2 min,d) 4 min,d,Explanation: The range of a general TCAS system is around 4 minutes before collision. At 45 seconds before collision TCAS gives traffic advisory and at 25 seconds before collision provides resolution advisory.
Question 846,6. What is the range of typical weather radar?,a) 500 nmi,b) 50 nmi,c) 5 nmi,d) 200 nmi,d,Explanation: The use of airborne weather radar is one method of storm avoidance. A weather radar system can show centers at a distance of up to 200 nmi.
Question 847,7. What is the frequency of operation of weather radar?,a) 1000 MHz,b) 500 kHz,c) 9375 MHz,d) 548 kHz,c,"Explanation: The weather radar operates at a frequency of 9375 MHz, corresponding to a wavelength of 3 cm. This small wavelength gets easily reflected from clouds containing high water concentrations."
Question 848,8. What is the gain required by a weather radar antenna?,a) 65 dB,b) 50 dB,c) 25 dB,d) 5 dB,c,"Explanation: The signal strength of echoes from storms located at a distance from the aircraft is very low, which requires the transmitter to operate at very high power levels and that the antenna have a gain of more than 25 dB."
Question 849,10. What is the minimum safe approach distance for a radar system operating in excess of 5kWhr?,a) 100ft,b) 10ft,c) 17ft,d) 4ft,d,"Explanation: With radar system operating in excess of 5kW output, the minimum safe approach distance to weather radar is about 4ft. "
