Photoconductors not consisting of a junction are known as junction less detectors.
Question 715,"7.	When an open circuited pn junction is illuminated",a) resistance increases,b) there is no effect,c) electron hole pairs are formed,d) capacitance increases,c,"Explanation: Upon illumination of an open circuited pn junction, electron hole pairs are generated. A small voltage appears across the junction and as a result it acts as a voltae source."
Question 716,"9.	Response time for gas-filled phototubes is _______",a) zero,b) intermediate,c) fast,d) slow,d,Explanation: Gas filled phototubes are generally very slow in response as compared to vacuum phototubes. This is due to the slow movement of ions towards the photocathode.
Question 717,"10.	 Reverse leakage current in a transistor _______",a) is affected by light,b) is not affected by light,c) increases with decrease in pressure,d) decreases with increase in temperature,a,Explanation: The reverse leakage current in a transistor is directly proportional to the intensity of light. It increases with the increase in the light intensity.
Question 718,"1.	Electronic recorders are of __________",a) 2 types,b) 4 types,c) 10 types,d) 15 types,a,"Explanation: Electronic recorders are of two types. They are as follows:•	Analog recorders•	Digital recorders."
Question 719,"4.	How many types of graphic recorders are there?",a) five,b) ten,c) three,d) one,c,"Explanation: There are three types of graphic recorders. They are as follows:•	Strip chart recorder•	Circular chart recorder•	X-Y recorder."
Question 720,"5.	Recorder is a ________",a) measuring instrument,b) voltage source,c) current divider,d) musical tool,a,Explanation: Recorder is a measuring equipment. A recorder is used to measure time varying quantities even if the quantity has stopped.
Question 721,"6.	Efficiency of a recorder is determined using ________",a) paper,b) chart,c) voltmeter,d) oscilloscope,b,"Explanation: The recorder efficiency is determined by means of a chart. Generally chart recorders are of three types. They are X-Y recorder, strip chart recorder and a circular chart recorder."
Question 722,"7.	In a strip chart recorder ________",a) biological quantity is measured,b) chemical quantity is measured,c) physical quantity is measured,d) no quantity is measured,c,Explanation: A strip chart recorder measures a physical quantity by making use of a continuous roll of chart paper at a constant speed.
Question 723,"8.	Basic elements of a strip chart recorder are ________",a) chalk and board,b) pen and pencil,c) pencil and paper,d) pen and chart paper,d,"Explanation: The basic elements of a strip chart recorder are pen and chart paper for recording data. Input data is recorded on a chart paper through the following methods:•	Pen and ink stylus•	Impact printing•	Chopper bar printing•	Thermal writing•	Electric writing•	Optical writing."
