Question 488,8. Which of the following method creates a new array object that looks at the same data?,a) view,b) copy,c) paste,d) all of the Mentioned,a,Explanation: The copy method makes a complete copy of the array and its data.
Question 489,9. Which of the following function can be used to combine different vectors so as to obtain the result for each n-uplet?,a) iid_,b) ix_,c) ixd_,d) all of the Mentioned,b,Explanation: Length of the 1D boolean array must coincide with the length of the dimension (or axis) you want to slice.
Question 490,"10. ndarray.dataitemSize is the buffer containing the actual elements of the array.",True ,FALSE,none,none,a,Explanation: ndarray.data is the buffer containing the actual elements of the array.
Question 491,1. Which of the following sets the size of the buffer used in ufuncs ?,a) bufsize(size),b) setsize(size),c) setbufsize(size),d) all of the Mentioned,c,Explanation: Adjusting the size of the buffer may therefore alter the speed at which ufunc calculations of various sorts are completed.
Question 492,2. Point out the wrong statement:,a) A universal function is a function that operates on ndarrays in an element-by-element fashion,"b) In Numpy, universal functions are instances of the numpy.ufunction class",c) Many of the built-in functions are implemented in compiled C code,d) All of the Mentioned,b,Explanation: ufunc instances can also be produced using the frompyfunc factory function.
Question 493,3. Which of the following attribute should be used while checking for type combination input and output ?,a) .types,b) .type,c) .class,d) all of the Mentioned,a,Explanation: Universal functions in NumPy are flexible enough to have mixed type signatures.
Question 494,4. Which of the following returns an array of ones with the same shape and type as a given array ?,a) all_like,b) ones_like,c) one_alike,d) all of the Mentioned,b,Explanation: The optional output arguments of the function can be used to help you save memory for large calculations.
Question 495,5. Point out the wrong statement:,a) Each universal function takes array inputs and produces array outputs,b) Broadcasting is used throughout NumPy to decide how to handle disparately shaped arrays,"c) The output of the ufunc is necessarily an ndarray, if all input arguments are ndarrays",d) All of the Mentioned,c,"Explanation: The output of the ufunc is not necessarily an ndarray, if all input arguments are not ndarrays."
Question 496,6. Which of the following set the floating-point error callback function or log object ?,a) setter,b) settercall,c) setterstack,d) all of the Mentioned,b,Explanation: seterr sets how floating-point errors are handled.
Question 497,"7. Some ufuncs can take output arguments.",TRUE ,FALSE,do not choose,Do not choose,b,"Explanation: All ufuncs can take output arguments.If necessary, output will be cast to the data-type of the provided output array."
Question 498,8. ___________ decompose the elements of x into mantissa and twos exponent.,a) trunc,b) fmod,c) frexp,d) ldexp,c,Explanation: fmod function return the element-wise remainder of division.
Question 499,9. Which of the following function take only single value as input ?,a) iscomplex,b) minimum,c) fmin,d) all of the Mentioned,a,"Explanation: iscomplex function returns a bool array, where True if input element is complex."
Question 500,"10. The array object returned by __array_prepare__ is passed to the ufunc for computation.",TRUE,FALSE,do not choose,Do not choose,a,"Explanation: If the class has an __array_wrap__ method, the returned ndarray result will be passed to that method just before passing control back to the caller."
