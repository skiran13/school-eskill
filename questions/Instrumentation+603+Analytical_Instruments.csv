Schottky TTL logic family does not have which of the following features?,a) Good fan-in,b) Good fan-out,c) High speed capability,d) High propagation delay,d,Explanation: Schottky TTL circuits have reduced propagation delay than normal TTL circuits. The propagation delay of 10ns is very high for some applications.
Question 815,7. The logic ‘0’ of ECL is represented as ______V and logic ‘1’ is represented as ______V.,"a) 1, 1.65","b) 0.9, 1.75","c) 1.2, 2.35","d) 1.9, 4.3",b,Explanation: The logic ‘0’ of ECL is represented as 0.9 V and logic ‘1’ is represented as 1.75 V. ECL stands for emitter-coupled logic.
Question 816,9. Which of the following is not the advantage of MOS gates?,a) Low power dissipation,b) Small size,c) Good immunity to noise,d) High switching speeds,d,Explanation: MOS gates do not have high switching speed. They have limited switching capability.
Question 817,10. CMOS gates are commercially available as which of the following series?,a) 1000,b) 2000,c) 3000,d) 4000,d,Explanation: CMOS gates are commercially available as 4000 series. This technique is most suitable for commercial circuits.
