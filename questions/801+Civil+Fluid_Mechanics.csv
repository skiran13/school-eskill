For a pipe of a uniform cross-section, no matter what the rate of flow is, the velocity of flow inside the pipe will always remain constant. Hence, itÕll always be a uniform flow. ItÕll be a steady flow if and only if the water level is maintained at a constant level by supplying water at the same rate as it gets discharged, else the water level will keep decreasing with time leading to an unsteady flow."
Question 202,6.

For a nozzle, the area gradually decreases towards itÕs exit. Thus, no matter what the rate of flow is, the velocity of flow at the nozzle exit will always be greater than that at itÕs entrance. Hence, itÕll always be an unsteady flow. It can be a steady flow if and only if the water level is maintained at a constant level by supplying water at the same rate as it gets discharged, else the water level will keep decreasing with time leading to an unsteady flow."

Thus, the rotation of a fluid particle will alwayds be associated with shear stress. Shear stress is in turn dependent on the viscosity. Hence, rotational flow occurs where the viscosity effects are predominant. Since, viscosity effects are predominant inside the blundary layer, the flow will be rotational in this region. However, outside the boundary layer, the viscosity effects are negligible. Hence, flow can be treated as irrotational outside the boundary layer."

Which of the following is true?,a) Flow is laminar inside the boundary layer and turbulent outside,b) Flow is turbulent inside the boundary layer and laminar outside,c) Flow is laminar both inside and outside of the boundary layer,d) Flow is turbulent both inside and outside of the boundary layer,a,"Explanation: Flows can be characterized as laminar or turbulent on the basis of ReynoldÕs number Re = _vd / _, where _ is the density, d is the pipe diameter and _ is the viscosity. For Re < 2000, the flow will be laminar and Re > 4000, the ow will be turbulent. For laminar flow, the viscosity effects must be high (_ should be high) as inside the boundary layer. Outside the boundary layer, the viscosity effects are negligible. Hence, the flow will be turbulent."

Thus, pathlines are concerned with a particular particle at successive instants of time and streamlines with a number of particles at the same instant."
Question 218,11.

It happens in the same way for Vr2. Thus, If the friction is neglected, then Vr1 = Vr2."
Question 1030,"8. If the pressure remains a constant, then ________",a) Vr1 > Vr2,b) Vr1 < Vr2,c) Vr1 = Vr2,d) Vr1 is a zero,c,"Explanation: The relative velocity of the jet is denoted as Vr1. It is the relative velocity at the inlet to the vane. Relative velocity of inlet to the vane is obtained by subtracting vectorially the velocity of the vane with its absolute velocity. It happens in the same way for Vr2. Thus, If the pressure remains a constant, then Vr1 = Vr2."
Question 1031,10. The efficiency of the vane is given by_________,a) 1-V22/ V12,b) 1-(V22/ V12),c) V22/ V12,d) 1- V12,a,"Explanation: In a velocity triangle at the inlet and the outlet, the control volume is moving with a uniform velocity. Therefore, the momentum theorem of the control volume is at a steady flow. Thus, the efficiency of the vane is given by 1-(V22/ V12)."
Question 1032,11. A jet strikes a curved plate at its ______,a) Sides,b) Surface,c) Centre,d) Does not strike,c,"Explanation: A jet strikes a curved plate at its centre. Force exerted by a jet on a stationery plate happens in three cases. The three cases are classified depending on their position. The three cases are when plate is vertical, plate is inclined and plate is curved with respect to the jet."
Question 1033,12. Jet propulsion of ship is less efficient than screw propeller due to_______,a) Pressure,b) Temperature,c) Frictional losses,d) Wear and tear,c,"Explanation: Jet propulsion of ship is less efficient than screw propeller due to large amount of frictional losses developed in the pump and the pipeline. Thus, it is rarely used in ships. "
Question 1034,13. Jet propulsion of ship in a very shallow water is needed to_________,a) Avoid sinking of the ship,b) Avoid damage of the propeller,c) Avoid current directions,d) Avoid surface damage,b,Explanation: Jet propulsion of ship in a very shallow water is needed to avoid damage of the propeller. Jet propulsion of ship is less efficient than screw propeller due to large amount of frictional losses developed in the pump and the pipeline.
Question 1035,14. A turbojet does not consist of which of the following component?,a) Compressor,b) Combustion chamber,c) Gas turbine,d) Air filter,d,"Explanation: A turbojet consists of four major components for an efficient working. The four components are compressor, combustion chamber, gas turbine and a nozzle. Air filter is not used in a turbojet."
Question 1036,15. Which among the following is not a type of jet engine?,a) Turbojet,b) Ramjet,c) Scramjet,d) Propulsive jet,d,"Explanation: A jet engine is broadly classified into four types of jet. The four types of jet are turbojet, ramjet, scramjet, and pulse jet. There isnÕt anything related to the propulsive jet and thus cannot be the answer."
