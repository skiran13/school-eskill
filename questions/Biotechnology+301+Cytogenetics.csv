Question Name,Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Answer,Explanation
Question 1,1. You grow a bacterial culture in a media containing N15 and transfer it to a media with N14. After two rounds of replication you perform a CsCl density gradient centrifugation of the DNA. How many bands will you observe what will be their intensity?,"a) One, very intense","b) Two, equally intense",c) Three with middle one more intense than upper and lower,d) Three equally intense,b,"Explanation: In semi conservative replication initially the DNA was N15-N15.  After 1st round of replication both strands were N14-N15, making only a single band as they have same density. In the next round we will get N14N14, and  N14-N15 making two bands which are equally intense for having 1:1 concentration."
Question 2,2. What will be the fate of a Seq A mutant E. Coli?,a) DNA replication will occur less frequently,b) Replication will be error prone,c) Replication will not occur,d) Uncontrolled replication,b,Explanation: Seq A ( Seq standing for sequestering) blocks the newly produced DNA stand from Methylase. This plays an important role in Mis-Match repair. In its absence Mis-match repair will be non functional producing erroneous DNA.
Question 3,3. At which end are the new DNA bases added?,a) 5Õ triphosphate end,b) 3Õ triphosphate end,c) 5Õ OH end,d) 3Õ OH end,d,Explanation: DNA replication proceeds from 5Õ -> 3Õ direction with new bases being added to 3Õ-OH end. 5Õ-P is at the beginning of DNA Strand.
Question 4,4. How many prokaryotic DNA polymerases have 5Õ->3Õ proofreading activity?,a) 1,b) 2,c) 3,d) 4,a,Explanation: Only DNA polymerase I has 5Õ->3Õ proofreading activity. Other polymerases like pol II and III have 3Õ -> 5Õ proofreading activity. There are mainly 3 prokaryotic DNA polymerases.
Question 5,5. Which is the most processive of prokaryotic DNA polymerases?,a) pol I,b) pol II,c) pol III,d) klenow fragment,c,"Explanation: DNA pol III holoenzyme has a processivity of >500,000 which is highest among prokaryotic polymerases. Pol I,II and Klenow fragment has no beta clamp resulting in their lesser processivity."
Question 6,7. In an experiment you take a DNA in vitro and attempt to replicate it. Which combination will you add to your DNA to get the maximum replication product?,"a) Dna a, Dna b, HU, SSB, topoisomerase I, polymerase I","b) Dna a, Dna b, HU, SSB, polymerase III","c) Dna a, Dna b,  Dna c, HU ,SSB  polymerase I","d) Dna a, Dna b, Dna c, HU, SSB, polymerase III",c,Explanation: DNA pol I has primase activity which is mandatory for starting DNA replication. As pol III lacks primase activity it will not be able to initiate replication. Also in vitro(specially in open DNA strand) topoisomerase doesnÕt have much role to play but Dna c is a must for replication as it loads the helicase.
Question 7,"8. In an experiment you use DNA pol  I Ð Klenow fragment. When all other requisites for replication are added, then what will be the effect on the newly replicated DNA? Consider leading strand only.",a) No difference from intact DNA pol I replication,b) Replication will be slower,c) Replication will be error prone,d) DNA produced will be shorter,d,Explanation: Klenow fragment provides the 5Õ -> 3Õ exonuclease activity used to remove the primer. In its absence the primer remains and hence DNA produced is shorter (i.e. original length-length of primer). 
Question 8,9. You take a circular ssDNA and to it you attach a small labeled complimentary fragment. You add different reagents and try to get free labeled probe. Which of this reagent will give you your desired result?,a) Dna b,b) Dna c,c) Dna G,d) Dna a,a,"Explanation: Dna b has helicase activity which can separate two complementary DNA strands, this will break the link between labeled fragment and circular DNA rendering it free. Dna G mainly has primase activity while Dna a and Dna c are required for replication initiation which donÕt give the desired result."
Question 9,10. Which of this subunit is not a part of core DNA polymerase?,a) Alpha,b) Beta,c) Theta,d) Eta,b,"Explanation: Beta is the clamp which helps to provide polymerase with higher processivity, however even in its absence DNA replication will take place although processivity of polymerase would be slow. Alpha is the centre for polymerase activity and it along with theta and eta forms the core polymerase."
Question 10,11. Rolling circle mode of replication is ________,a) Conservative,b) Non Conservative,c) Semi Ð Conservative,d) Dispersed,c,Explanation: One cycle of replication results in an inner parent circular strand and outer daughter circular strand making the process semi-conservative. It would have been conservative if resultant parent and daughter strand would be on different molecules and dispersed if both strands would have some part of parent and daughter.
Question 11,12. What constitutes Primosome?,"a) Dna a, Dna b, Dna c, Dna G","b) Dna b, Dna G","c) Dna c, Dna b","d) Dna a, Dna c",b,"Explanation: Dna b, the helicase, and Dna G, the primase, constitutes the primosome necessary for initiation. Dna a mainly generates a strain allowing Dna c to load the helicase Dna b."
Question 12,"13. If we mutate the DNA ligase and observe the length of the replicated strands in different time slots after replication initiation, what will we observe?",a) The DNA will gradually increase in length till it is fully replicated,b) Small fragments of DNA will be obtained increasing in number with time,c) Mixture of small and long Fragments of definite length from the start whose concentration simply increases with time,"d) At first small fragment, then two separate bands showing long fragment with increasing length and short fragments of definite length.",d,Explanation: The small fragments are the Okazaki fragments of lagging strand while the longer is the leading stand DNA. While leading strand grows in length the Okazaki fragments in absence of ligation to each other results in small fragments of definite length.
Question 13,14. Acyclovir is a drug used to treat viral infection by impairing its replication. Why will it not effect bacterial replication as well?,a) Bacteria under viral attack donÕt replicate,b) Viral polymerase binds to it and thus canÕt perform its function,c) Virus uses it in a polymerization,d) Cellular mechanism deactivates it,c,"Explanation: Acyclovir is a GMP analogue that cellular mechanism activates to GTP analogue, which the virus uses as a substrate while polymerizing. However, as it lacks 3Õ-OH it terminates the replication process. Thus, cellular processes activate this drug, yet its specificity to viral polymerase protects the cell."
Question 14,15. DNA replication in the two strands proceed in opposite direction as they are aligned oppositely with respect to 3Õ and 5Õ ends,(   5ÕÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ-3Õ,                                                3ÕÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑÑ-5Õ).,In this context which of the following is true.,a) The two arms of the DNA Pol are exactly same with same orientation,a,"Explanation: The two arms have the core subunits and beta clamp in the same orientation. The DNA strand loops through the lagging strand synthesizing arm to allow polymerization in the same direction (say right to left). However, both arms would polymerize from 5Õ->3Õ direction only."
Question 15,1. In case of eukaryotes replication initiates at ________,a) TATA,b) CpG islets,c) AUG,d) ARS,d,Explanation: Replication begins at ARS Ð Autonomous Replicating Sequences. While TATA and CpG islets are characteristics of promoter elements which controls transcription. Translation initiates at AUG codon.
Question 16,2. Here are names of some factors necessary for prokaryotic replication. Which of these or their homologue is unnecessary for eukaryotes?,a) Dna G,b) Dna b,c) Beta clamp,d) SSB,a,"Explanation: DNA G (gyrase) is not needed for eukaryotes. While Dna b homologue MCM, Beta clamp homologue PCNA and SSB homologue RPA are necessary."
Question 17,"3. You wanted to find out the importance of the DNA polymerases. So, you mutated the polymerases one by one and checked for survival. In which of these mutant cases will you see least survival rate?",a) Alpha,b) Beta,c) Delta,d) Eta,a,"Explanation: Alpha has primase activity. Without a primer DNA synthesis canÕt initiate thus Alpha polymerase is indispensible. While the beta is mainly needed for repair mechanisms it doesnÕt make much difference. However, delta and eta are main polymerases for eukaryotes and their mutation will have major effects as well."
Question 18,4. You design a circular ssDNA with a labeled RNA primer (alpha-P32 labeling). You add polymerase epsilon and required enzymes for replication to the fragment. What will you expect to see on autoradiography after gel electrophoresis?,a) Single labeled band with some labeling at the bottom region,b) Two labeled band one much lower than the other with labeling at the bottom region,c) No band but labeling at the bottom,d) Two labeled band one much lower than the other with no labeling at the bottom,d,"Explanation: Alpha-P32 incorporated the label in the entire RNA primer fragment. As polymerization will take place the 5Õ->3Õ exonuclease activity of pol eta will produce labeled oligomers of that RNA. One band will correspond to unreplicated DNA, the lower one to oligomer. No labeled monomer is produced."
Question 19,5. You design a plasmid with a gene for Histidine synthesis and a fragment containing ARS. You introduce it yeast culture and try to grow then in Histidine deficit media. What will be your observation?,a) No growth,b) One or two colonies,c) Rapid growth with many colonies,d) Normal growth with countable colonies,c,Explanation: ARS promotes replication of the yeast. Even if the plasmid was initially taken up by few cells due to rapid replication brought about by ARS the number of colony massively increases. If the same experiment was done with any random stretch of DNA none or few colonies would be seen. 
Question 20,6. Deletion of which domain of ARS would give the least replication rate in eukaryotes?,a) A domain,b) B1 domain,c) B2 domain,d) B3 domain,a,Explanation: The 11bp ÔA domainÕ is the primary functional area of the ARS. Mutation in this domain gives 0% functionality of ORC so lease replication. Other mutations also reduce replication rate but not to such extent.
Question 21,7. Which subunit in MCM is not phosphorylated in MCM after initiation is triggered?,a)  1,b) 2,c) 3,d) 7,b,Explanation: MCM has 6 subunits numbered from 2 to 7. After initiation of replication is triggered all subunits other than 2 are phosphorylated.
Question 22,8. You are given a DNA fragment with a CBD lesion. Which polymerase(s) will you use to replicate this fragment without taking care of the error?,"a) _ (zeta), _ (eta)","b) _ (eta), ) _ (theta)","c) _ (theta), _ (kappa)","d) _ (kappa),_ (theta)",b,"Explanation: Eta introduces two random base against the lesion say AA or TT.  However, it is very error prone and requires zeta to carry out the remaining replication. Kappa and theta also participate in repair but by other ways."
Question 23,9. We know that Beta clamp in bacteria has two subunits and takes the shape of a ring. Which of this will be characteristic of PCNA which is a beta clamp homologue for eukaryotes?,a) Two subunits forming ring,b) Three subunits forming ring,c) Four subunits forming figure 8 like structure,d) Four subunits forming a larger ring,b,Explanation: PCNA has three subunits but its structure is similar (ring) like two subunit beta clamp. Larger ring formation would be unreasonable as the basic structure of DNA is exactly the same for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Question 24,10. What is the function of RFC in eukaryotic replication?,a) Catalytic subunit,b) SSB,c) Clamp loader,d) Primase,c,Explanation: RFC or Replication Factor C is the eukaryotic homologue of clamp loader. It loads the PCNA clamp. Eukaryotic replication primer is formed by alpha polymerase while RPA acts as SSB. 
Question 25,1.  Cyclin-CDK complex (here considering S cyclin) when active is responsible for phosphorylating several proteins and this often marks then for destruction by ubiquitination. What would be its effect on Cdt activity?,a) Activation,b) Inactivation,c) Destruction,d) Increased synthesis,a,"Explanation: Cdt a protein necessary for initiation of replication is sequestered by geminin. S-cyclin-CDK phosphorylates and marks geminin for ubiquitination which makes Cdt free to express its activity. However, it has no effect on Cdt concentration or synthesis."
Question 26,2. Which of these would you use as a competitive inhibitor for Cdt?,a) MCM 1,b) MCM 2,c) MCM 7,d) MCM 10,d,"Explanation: MCM 10 replaces Cdt from pre-replication complex triggering the phosphorylation in the next step. Thus, it must have a similar structure to Cdt and can act as a competitive inhibitor. While there is no MCM 1, MCM 2-7 form a member helicase."
Question 27,3. What is the fate of phosphorylated Cdc 6?,a) It is transported outside nucleus,b) It is ubiquitinylated,c) It gets activated,d) It forms a complex with Cdt,b,Explanation: Cdc 6 after triggering initiation dissociates from ORC and is phosphorylated to prevent re-initiation. It undergoes ubiquitination and destruction while MCM is phosphorylated and transported outside the nucleus. It ensures that Cdc 6 and MCM remain inactive and canÕt re-initiate replication. 
Question 28,4.  Pre-replication complex is necessary to initiate replication. It assembles in______________,a) Late Anaphase,b) G1 phase,c) S phase,d) Early Anaphase,b,Explanation: Pre-replication complex assembles on ORC in G1 phase. It is triggered in S phase when no new Pre-RC assembly takes place. Even during early Anaphase and late Anaphase this complex assembly is prevented.
Question 29,5. Which Cyclin-CDK complex will you find most active in M phase?,a) Cyclin A- CDK 2,b) Cyclin B- CDK 1,c) Cyclin D- CDK 2,d) Cyclin E- CDK 1,b,"Explanation: Cyclin B Ð CDK 1 is corresponding to the yeast M-Cyclin-CDK complex which is active during M phase and leads to Anaphase. Cyclin D is G1-S cyclin, Cyclin A is S cyclin and Cyclin E is G1 cyclin respectively."
Question 30,6.  What is the DNA composition of ARS?,a) A-T rich,b) G-C rich,"c) Repeating A-T, G-C sequence",d) No specific sequence speciality,a,"Explanation: A-T bases bound by 2 hydrogen bonds unlike G and C, which are bound by 3 hydrogen bonds. In such region DNA strand separation is easier as compared to G-C rich regions. Hence, ARS which requires DNA melting to initiate replication is A-T rich. "
Question 31,"7. In an experiment, you are working on mitochondrial chromosomes. Which polymerase will ensure accurate replication?",a) pol beta,b) pol delta,c) pol iota,d) pol gamma,d,"Explanation: Pol gamma is the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, while pol beta is mainly necessary for repair. Pol iota associates with translesion DNA synthesis. Pol delta is the primary nuclear DNA polymerase."
Question 32,"8. To your cultured cell lines, you add growth factors like cytokines which act through MAPK cascade pathway. Which transition will it trigger?",a) S->G2,b) M->Anaphase,c) G1->S,d) G2->M,c,Explanation: One of the primary checkpoints to overcome incase of proliferation is G1 -> S check point. MAPK cascade leads to transcription of genes required to increase the CDK activity that leads to this transition. Once S phase is completed the cell must undergo mitosis although there is another checkpoint before Anaphase.
Question 33,1. Which protein mentioned below can reverse central dogma?,a) Ribosome,b) Restriction Endonuclease,c) Reverse Transcriptase,d) RNA Polymerase,c,"Explanation: Reverse transcriptase helps in cDNA synthesis from RNA, which is opposite to the central dogma, where RNA is synthesized from DNA. Ribosome and RNA polymerases obey central dogma, while Restriction Endonuclease is unrelated as it simply cleaves DNA at a specific site."
Question 34,2. The catalytic activity resides in which subunit of RNA polymerase?,a)  __ (156 kDa),b) _ (151 kDa),c) _ (37 kDa),d) _70 (70 kDa),a,Explanation: __ and _ subunits are mainly associated with the transcription start site where __ subunit mainly confers the catalytic activity. The sigma subunit provides specificity while alpha subunit interacts with regulatory proteins.
Question 35,3. What is the direction in which the transcript produced by RNA polymerase grows?,a) 3Õ->5Õ direction on 3Õ->5Õ strand,b) 5Õ->3Õ direction on 5Õ->3Õ strand,c) 3Õ->5Õ direction on 5Õ->3Õ strand,d) 5Õ->3Õ direction on 3Õ->5Õ strand,d,"Explanation: In the process of RNA synthesis there is a short phase of hybrid DNA-RNA formation. This is possible only when two strands are oppositely oriented. As 3Õ-OH is necessary for adding new nucleotides, RNA is synthesized from 5Õ->3Õ direction, so the template must be 3Õ->5Õ oriented. "
Question 36,4. In an experiment you use RNA polymerase without its sigma factor for transcription. What will be the result that you observe?,a) More transcription,b) Less transcription,c) More specific transcription,d) More random transcription,d,Explanation: Sigma subunit is responsible for recognizing the transcription start site. In its absence the RNA pol will transcribe at non-specific random sites. Sigma plays no role in the rate of transcription so there is no chance in transcription rate in its absence.
Question 37,5. In an experiment you mutate the consensus sequence at the -10 box. You observe the rate of transcription reduces. Now you make complementary mutation to the sigma factor. What will you observe?,a) Further decrease in transcription rate,b) Increase in transcription rate,c) Original transcription rate,d) Increase in rate of random transcription,c,"Explanation: Complementary mutation in sigma factor helps to restore its -10 box recognition capacity which restores normal transcription rate. However, to improve the rate further both the -10 and -35 box sequences should be made more like the consensus."
Question 38,"6. You wanted to isolate active RNA polymerase (with a part of the transcript associated with it ) from cellular mix. For this, you perform an immunoprecipitation with anti sigma antibody. Then you check the precipitate. What will you observe?",a) RNA polymerase with transcript,b) RNA polymerase without transcript,c) Only antibody,d) DNA with associated RNA polymerase and a transcript,b,"Explanation: Sigma factor dissociates after initiation so anti sigma antibody will only pull down RNA polymerase prior to promoter clearance. Thus, the polymerases so obtained have no transcript associated."
Question 39,7. Which part of sigma factor associates with -10box?,a) 1.2,b) 2.4,c) 4.4,d) 4.2,b,Explanation: the 2.4 i.e. (4th part of 2nd subunit) associates with the -10box in promoter. While 4.2 associates with -35box of the promoter. 1.2 sub unit doesnÕt associate with DNA; and there is no 4.4 unit in sigma factor.
Question 40,"8. You want to find out which of the consequent gene X or Y is being transcribed. For this you do a hybridization competition analysis and plot the radioactivity curve with increasing concentration of the competitor unlabelled mRNA. If the transcribed gene was X, which observation fits your result?",a) The radioactivity of y decreases while that of x remains the same,b) The radioactivity of x decreases while that of y remains the same,c) The radioactivity of x and y decreases,d) The radioactivity of y decreases while x increases,b,Explanation: As the unlabelled mRNA against X will compete with the labeled one for hybridization the intensity of radioactivity will gradually decrease with increased concentration. But as it will not bind to Y gene the Y labeled mRNA faces no competition and its intensity remains same.
Question 41,9. Which of these is the 1st event to take place during transcription initiation?,a) Formation of a closed initiation complex,b) Formation of open initiation complex,c) Formation of absorptive transcript,d) Promoter clearance,b,Explanation: When the RNA pol is attached to DNA strands that have still not melted the complex so formed is called open initiation complex. When the DNA melts it is known as open initiation complex. This follows the formation of abortive transcript and promoter clearance.
Question 42,10. The catalytic unit of RNA polymerases when placed properly during initiation is just over _________,a) -1 site,b) 0 site,c) +1 site,d) Ð 10 site,c,Explanation: The catalytic subunit is exactly over the first nucleotide of mRNA which is at +1 site. -1 signifies one site upstream to initiation while there is no 0 site. -10 box is recognized by sigma factor.
Question 43,11. In an experiment you mutate the C terminal domain of alpha subunit of the RNA polymerase. What will you expect to see?,a) Transcription is absent,b) Transcription is at random sites,c) Transcription is less,d) Transcription is more,c,"Explanation: The C terminal domain of the alpha subunit is responsible for binding to the UP elements of the promoter. Such binding helps to enhance transcription so in absence of the binding transcription will be slower. However, still transcription will occur due to the presence of core promoter."
Question 44,13. In an experiment you add increasing amount of sigma factor to a mixture of DNA fragment and core polymerase in vitro. You also add [14C]ATP and  [_-32P]ATP in the mixture and check the rate of incorporation. Results show that the incorporation of both of this labels increase on adding more sigma factor. What will you conclude from your observation?,a) Sigma confers specificity and increases transcription rate,b) Sigma increases initiation and elongation rate,c) Sigma increases initiation of transcription rate,d) Sigma causes faster elongation,b,"Explanation: [_-32P]ATP incorporation marks more initiation while [14C]ATP incorporation indicates elongation. As on adding sigma factor both incorporations seems to increase, sigma must increase both initiation and elongation rate."
Question 45,"14. In an experiment, you wanted to see which mutation will have worse effect on transcription. In the 1st set you deleted 94 amino acids from the C-terminus and in the 2nd set you replace the 265th C-terminal arginine to cystine. Which in your opinion will have the worst effect?",a) 94 amino acid mutant,b) 265th amino acid mutant,c) Both will have similar negative effect,d) No visible effect on rate of transcription,c,"Explanation: This is because the 265th arginine is most important for recognition of the up element. Thus, its deletion alone can have a similar negative effect on transcription to the deletion of 94 amino acids from C terminal end."
Question 46,15. Which cation is placed in the catalytic subunit of RNA polymerase?,a) Zn2+,b) Mn2+,c) Mg2+,d) Fe3+,c,"Explanation: Magnesium ion is mandatory for the catalytic action as it shields the negative charge of the phosphate groups of rNTPs and also promotes the nucleophilic attack by the 3Õ-OH group. Manganese, zinc and iron are part of other biologically important enzymes."
Question 47,1. While studying the transcripts in vitro you observe that other than the longer transcripts there are some short stretches of RNA oligomer produced as well. You repeat the experiment several times but these oligomers seem to persist. What is the possible explanation?,a) Procedural error,b) They are the un-ligated oligomers of lagging strand,c) Experimental artifact,d) Normal occurrence,c,Explanation: These short oligomers are abortive transcripts produced by the RNA polymerase before it leaves the promoter. There is no lagging strand in RNA and since the experiment is repeated several times with caution the other justifications are rules out.
Question 48,2. Capping of RNA is necessary as_______,a) It helps us distinguish 5Õ from 3Õ end,b) It has a rolling action and condenses the transcript as it is produced,c) To protect the transcript from exonuclease,d) To prevent the transcript from sticking to DNA,c,"Explanation: There are several free exonuclease in the nucleus and the 5Õ cap protects the mRNA from them. In its absence, valuable information will be lost from the transcript and abnormal proteins would result after translation. RNA normally font stick to DNA and absence of ATPase activity rules out 2nd option."
Question 49,3. What is the 1st nucleotide of a completely synthesized transcript?,a) A,b) G,c) C,d) T,b,Explanation: The 5Õ cap can be considered as the 1st nucleotide of the complete transcript. And as it is ppGpp the nucleotide is Guanine or G.
Question 50,4. Processivity of RNA polymerase is ________,a) Very high,b) High,c) Low,d) Very low,a,Explanation: RNA polymerase is highly processive as when the sigma subunit dissociates the DNA binding arm of RNA polymerase clamps shut around the DNA prevents it from falling off. DNA polymerase I on the other hand has low processivity.
Question 51,5. Which antibiotic inhibits transcription elongation?,a) Rifampicin,b) Streptolydigin,c) Penicillin,d) Tetracyclin,b,Explanation: Streptolydigin prevents elongation while Rifampicin prevents initiation. Penicillin and Tetracyclin act on the ribosome and not on RNA polymerase although even they ultimately inhibit protein synthesis.
Question 52,6. You design a reconstructive RNA polymerase where you take the beta and alpha subunit from a rifampicin resistant strain and beta prime and sigma subunit from rifampicin sensitive strain. You check the rate of transcription by this RNA polymerase after the addition of the antibiotic. What will be your observation?,a) No transcription,b) Reduced transcription,c) Normal transcription,d) Improved transcription,c,Explanation: The beta subunit of the RNA polymerase is mainly sensitive to Rifampicin. Thus the re-constructed RNA pol is overall Rifampicin resistant and transcription rate will be normal.
Question 53,7. You add labeled Uridine analogue to the mixture of DNA and RNA pol in vitro. What are you trying to determine?,a) Catalytic subunit of RNA pol,b) Processivity of RNA pol,c) Presence of DNA Ð RNA hybrid,d) Length of DNA already transcribed,c,"Explanation: The Uridine analogue can base pair with the RNA pol enzyme when there is a presence of a complementary strand (here DNA). Thus, its incorporation and cross linking will confirm the presence of RNA-DNA hybrid. We use labeled NTP to detect the other processes mentioned."
Question 54,8. Which of these is not a part of RNA polymerase elongation machinery?,a) NTP entry channel,b) RNA entry channel,c) DNA entry channel,d) Clamp,b,Explanation: As the RNA is synthesized there is an RNA exit channel but there is no need of RNA entry channel. Clamp and flap on the other hand help to stabilize the polymerase structure.
Question 55,9. Melting of DNA would lead to _________________,a) Increase in UV absorption,b) Increase in Fluorescence,c) Decrease in UV absorption,d) Decrease in fluorescence,a,Explanation: Melting is the separation of the two strands of DNA which causes an increase in the amount of UV rays absorbed by the DNA. This is known as Hyperchromic shift. It has no effect on florescence of DNA.
Question 56,"10. In a stretch of DNA being transcribed, the region forward to the Elongation is __________",a) Positively supercoiled,b) Negatively supercoiled,c) Uncoiled,d) Forms a secondary structure,a,Explanation: The region forward to the RNA polymerase elongation machinery is positively supercoiled due to the strain. If the gyrase doesnÕt release this strain the polymerizing machinery will stall. Such regions canÕt be uncoiled or folded.
Question 57,1.  What form of helix would you expect to see in double stranded RNA?,a) A form,b) B form,c) C form,d) D form,a,Explanation: Double stranded RNA generally forms A form helix while double stranded DNA forms B form helix. The other forms also occur in DNA under special conditions.
Question 58,2. A ssRNA shows inverted tandem repeat. What would be its secondary structure?,a) Linear,b) Hair pin,c) Stem-loop structure,d) Crucifix,c,Explanation: A tandem repeat has some bases between the palindrome regions resulting in the formation of the loop. The remaining complementary sequences of the palindrome forms the stem. In case of dsRNA similar sequence would form a crucifix while absence of intersecting sequence will form hairpin.
Question 59,3. To study the functioning of intrinsic terminator you increase the number of G-C base pairs in the stem and decrease the U bases from the tail region. What would be its effect on termination?,a) No visible effect,b) Efficiency will decrease,c) Efficiency will increase,d) The RNA polymerase will stall at the terminator,a,"Explanation:  The increase in number of G-C base pairs in the stem region stabilizes the stem, and decreasing in number of U in the tail destabilizes it. These two have a compensating effect on terminator efficiency."
Question 60,4. Which of these interactions is the weakest?,a) rC-dG,b) rG-dC,c) rA-dT,d) rU-dA,d,Explanation: The interaction between A and T or U base is through 2 hydrogen bonds only. So this is weaker than G-C which mediates by 3 hydrogen bonds. Further RNA DNA interactions are weaker making rU-dA the weakest of interaction which is used in termination of transcription.
Question 61,5. You modify your gene DNA sequence by introducing an attenuator within the transcribed region. You isolate the labeled gene product and perform SDS PAGE. You observe two bands one higher and another slightly lower. Which of this band corresponds to properly modified sequence?,a) Higher,b) Lower,c) Both the bands as they show differently folded protein,d) This is an experimental artifact,b,Explanation: An attenuator will lead to premature transcription termination. This will result in a truncated protein that will migrate faster in the gel and form the lower band. Protein folding doesnÕt affect its migration in SDS page.
Question 62,"6. Rho protein, that is necessary for transcription termination, is a ________",a) Homotetramer,b) Heterotetramer,c) Heterohexamer,d) Homohexamer,d,"Explanation: Rho is a 46KDa hexameric protein with 6 identical subunits. Thus, it is a holohexamer. A four subunit protein with all identical subunit would be a holotetramer, not identical subunit would be heterotetramer respectively."
Question 63,7. Rho shows base preference although it doesnÕt have any concensus cis binding sequence. Which region will be expected to bind Rho better?,a) G and C rich region,b) A and T rich region,c) Region rich in C and poor in G,d) Region rich in A and poor in T,c,Explanation: Rho binds best to regions having high C content as much as 41% and low G content as much as 14%. As in RNA there is no compulsory base pairing the amount of G is not necessary equal to the amount of c.
Question 64,8. Rho dependent termination mechanism doesnÕt reguire____________,a) ATP,b) Stem loop structure,c) G-C rich stem,d) Sigma factor,d,"Explanation: Sigma factor plays no role in termination, rather it dissociates long before the RNA pol terminates. Rho however requires ATP for its rolling function and the stem loop structure formation. This stem loop structure is strengthened by G-C rich regions in the stem. "
Question 65,9.  When Rho catches up with RNA polymerase it _______,a) Stalls,b) Falls off,c) Backtracks,d) Moves on,b,"Explanation: Rho protein helps in termination of transcription. It binds to the growing transcript rolls up and catches up with the polymerase when the loop starts to form. This dissociates the complex from the DNA leading to the formation of free Rho, DNA, RNA transcript and polymerase."
Question 66,10. You can see non-cannonical base pairing in________,a) dsDNA,b) ssDNA,c) dsRNA,d) ssRNA,c,"Explanation: Along with canonical base pairing with the normal base pairs according to Watson-Crick rules, dsRNA also forms non-cannonical base pairs. However, dsDNA canÕt do so. ssRNA and ssDNA are called so because they are single stranded so there is no base pairing at all. "
Question 67,12. Which of these proteins help to backtrack the RNA?,a) XPC,b) Dna G,c) TFIIH,d) CSA,d,Explanation: When the RNA polymerase encounters a bulky lesion the NER protein CSA heps the RNA to backtrack giving the NER mechanism a clearance of 100bp to act. XPC and TFIIH are also needed in NER but have different function. DNA G is a primase needed in prokaryotic replication.
Question 68,1.  If you study T4 bacteriophage transcription with holoenzyme which genes will you expect to be transcribed?,a) Immediate early,b) Early,c) Delayed,d) Late,a,Explanation: Sigma factor in holoenzyme ensures transcription of immediate early gene first soon after viral infection. This is followed by delayed and late gene transcription. Core  Enzyme shows no such specificity.
Question 69,2. You transcribe a gene and obtain mRNA. To detect which strand is transcribed you replicate each strand in vitro and use the newly synthesized strand for hybridization with mRNA. If mRNA hybridize with the newly replicated strand from 1st strand then the gene transcribed was in ________,a) 1st strand,b) 2nd strand,c) Same copy in both strands,d) Dispersed,b,"Explanation: mRNA produced from 1st strand and DNA produced by replicating 1st strand should have the same sequence and they will not hybridize. However, if the gene is transcribed from 2nd strand then this result is possible. RNA pol only transcribes one strand at a time so dispersed and both being transcribed are not possible."
Question 70,3. When sigma subunit dissociates from the RNA polymerase what happens to the DNA binding clamp of the core?,a) It opens again,b) It closes again,c) It enters a semi open stage,d) It is phophorylated and ubiquitination occurs,d,Explanation: In the absence of the sigma subunit initially the RNA Pol clamp is closed. Sigma makes a window of open clamp conformation when RNA pol loads on the DNA. When sigma dissociates the clamp closes again around the DNA preventing the pol to fall off.
Question 71,4. In an experiment you wrongly added Rifampicin antibiotic to Rifampicin sensitive bacteria. You try to correct your mistake by adding more core subunits (resistant to Rifampicin) to your mixture. What would you expect to see?,a) Normal transcription to restart,b) Transcription will restart but it will be non-specific as you added core enzyme,c) Impaired transcription with more abortive transcripts,d) No transcription,a,Explanation: The sigma factor is not affected by Rifampicin and it is dissociable. The sigma already present in mixture will add to the Rifampicin resistant core and restore normal transcription of specific genes. No increased abortive transcription will be seen.
Question 72,5. Which is the primary sigma factor in Bacillus subtilis?,a) _70,b) _43,c) _35,d) _32,b,Explanation: _43 is the normally active sigma factor for Bacillus subtilis while _70 is the normally active sigma factor for E. coli. _32 is expressed under stressed conditions like heat shock when it competes with _70 for RNA pol core.
Question 73,6. What is the function of 1st subunit of sigma factor in _70 and _43?,a) It helps to bind sigma to DNA,b) It helps to bind sigma to core beta subunit,c) It helps to bind sigma to core alpha subunit,d) It prevents sigma to bind to DNA,d,Explanation: The 1st region forms a flap like structure that blocks the DNA binding sites. This helps to prevent unbound sigma to bind to DNA. That will only block the DNA binding site and lead to no transcription in absence of RNA pol.
Question 74,7. Loosening the binding between polymerase and non-specific site is important to confer higher specificity. In Bacillus subtilis what is responsible for this action?,a) Sigma factor,b) Alpha subunit,c) Beta subunit,d) Delta subunit,d,"Explanation: While _70 in E. coli has an extra 245 amino acid that helps it to loosen the polymerase from non-specific site, _43 in Bacillus subtilis lacks it. Thus, it needs another subunit of core polymerase- delta subunit to perform this function."
Question 75,8. We know that region 2.4 of sigma factor binds DNA at -10box. What is the function of 2.1?,a) It is a flexible loop with no known function,b) It binds -35box,c) It binds RNA polymerase,d) It binds region 4.1 to give sigma its specific structure and function,c,Explanation: Region 2.1 helps to bind the sigma factor to the RNA polymerase. The binding is not absolute as this factor is dissociable. -35box on the other hand is recognized by region 4.2.
Question 76,9. Which DNA binding domain is seen in region 4.2 of sigma factor?,a) Zinc fingers,b) Helix turn helix,c) Leucine zipper,d) Beta barrel,b,Explanation: Region 4.2 of sigma subunit has a helix turn helix motif that helps it to bind to the major groove of DNA. The similar motif has been seen in region 3 as well. Zinc fingers and leucine zipper are examples of other DNA binding motif.
Question 77,10. Which sigma factor is bound to Rse A?,a) _D,b) _G,c) _F,d) _E,d,"Explanation: Rse A binds _E and prevents it from activating transcription. Under extreme conditions this binding is broken by cleavage of c terminal cytosolic tail of transmambrane Rse A, thus releasing _E for transcribing necessary genes."
Question 78,11. You artificially increase the level of _32 in an E. coli culture. What will you expect to see?,a) rpo H transcription permanently inhibited,b) cdc transcription constitutively turned on,c) rpo H temporarily activated,d) cdc 6 permanently turned off,c,Explanation: _32 is necessary for transcribing genes like rpo H that helps in surviving heat shock while it doesnÕt act on cdc6 that has a role in replication. As _32 is unstable it temporarily turns on rho H till the concentration ratio of _32 and _70 returns to normal.
Question 79,"12. If a bacteria is facing lack of carbon sources in the media, which sigma factor concentration is expected to increase?",a) Sigma E,b) Sigma S,c) Sigma 70,d) Sigma 32,b,"Explanation: Sigma S is synthesized when the cell is under stressed conditions as in stationary phase. It transcribes rpo S gene which helps to overcome carbon starvation in stationary phase. Sigma E works in extreme conditions of shock, while sigma 70 and 43 work in normal conditions. "
Question 80,1.  You want your bacterial culture to grow well so you made an enriched media with all forms of carbohydrates. Which of this carbohydrate should you restore first if you want the culture to keep growing at the same rate?,a) Glucose,b) Lactose,c) Galactose,d) Fructose,a,"Explanation: Prokaryotes first use all the glucose in the media to derive energy. Only when they sense a low glucose level they search alternative energy sources like lactose, fructose or galactose."
Question 81,2. In a mero-diploid you have one I- and one I+ Repressor gene in the two lac operons. I+ is wild type while I- is a mutant which produces a repressor that doesnÕt bind. What would be the functionality of the diploid?,a) Function normally,b) Will be non-functional,c) May or may not function,d) Will have impaired functioning,a,"Explanation: The set of gene product produced from the wild type I+ loci will be sufficient to induce repression in both the operons. Thus, the system will not be impaired or non-functional."
Question 82,3. Which of these Lac operon mero- diploid will be constitutively turned on? Considering the terms has their usual meaning.,a) I+ + P + O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,b) I+ + P + OC + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,c) Is + P + O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,d) I+ + P + O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / IÐ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,b,Explanation: OC is an operon that canÕt bind to the repressor. Consecutively it is always turned on. IS produces a repressor which binds tightly to operon and never lets it turn on- This is the case of constitutively turning off.
Question 83,4. Which of these combinations will result is am operon that can never produce beta galactosidse?,a) IÐ + P + O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,b) I+ + P + OC + ZÐ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ O+ + ZÐ + Y+ + A+,c) Is + P + OC + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / I+ + P+ OC + Z+ + Y+ + A+,d) I-d + P + O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+ / IÐ + P+ O+ + Z+ + Y+ + A+,b,"Explanation: This is because although this operon is constitutively turned on, yet it has a mutated lac Z gene which produces beta galactosidase. This mutation exists in both of the loci so it canÕt produce this enzyme even if the operon is on. "
Question 84,5. Which of the Ars operon regulation site is actually preventing RNA polymerase from binding and producing the Ara genes BAD?,a) O1,b) O2,c) P,d) Z,b,Explanation: Although O2 is much farther from the ara promoter P yet it can regulate P as it loops out and reaches the site. On the other hand O1 however being closer doesnÕt control the promoter of BAD genes.
Question 85,6. Which of these Ara genes is a mode of feedback autoregulation?,a) Ara A,b) Ara B,c) Ara C,d) Ara D,c,Explanation: As ara C level rises it itself binds beside its promoter preventing the RNA polymerase to bind to the same there by having a negative feedback control. Ara BAD promoter lacks this type of control and is regulate din different way.
Question 86,7. In which of this condition is Ara operon functional?,a) When repressor binds to O2 and I1,b) When repressor binds to O1 and I2,c) When repressor binds to I2 and I1,d) When repressor binds to O2 and Pc,c,Explanation: When repressor binds to I1 and I2 then RNA polymerase faces no hindrance in binding to the promoter and the genes are turned on. On the other hand when induces the repressor bind to O2 and I1 which leads to the looping out and turning off.
Question 87,8. Which of the Ara promoter regulation is controlled by binding of repressors on the O1 regulating unit?,a) PA,b) PB,c) PC ,d) PD,c,Explanation: When Ara C is produced in excess it bind to O1 and represses the promoter PC. This is true as o1 lies closer to PC. However the other promoter PBAD has a regulating unit O2 that acts from a distance by looping out.  
Question 88,1.  Which of these operons is anabolic?,a) Lac,b) Ara,c) Trp,d) Phe,c,Explanation: Trp operon is anabolic as it codes for enzymes that help in the synthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. On the other hand Ara and Lac operons are catabolic as they help in breaking down the respective sugar.
Question 89,2. Which of these systems give the best mode for turning trp operon off?,a) Repressor,b) Attenuator,c) Repressor with a downstream poly A tail,d) Repressor with an attenuator,d,Explanation:  A repressor provides 70 fold lowering of expression while an attenuator provided an additional 10 fold lowering of expression. Together they have a net effect of 700 fold repression over the trp operon.
Question 90,3. A Lac repressor is a tetramer repressed when bound to the inducer. The trp repressor is a ____________________,a) Dimer inactivated when bound to the inducer,b) Dimer activated on inducer binding,c) Tetramer inactivated on inducer binding,d) Tetramer activated on inducer binding,b,Explanation: A trp repressor is a dimer which canÕt bind to the cis element unless it is bound to the inducer tryptophan. Only then it undergoes conformational change such that it then binds to the operator.
Question 91,4. Which of these properties do not agree with trp operon attenuator?,a) It brings about repression of trp operon,b) It consists of one stem loop system,c) It has two codons for tryptophan in sequence,d) Ribosome stalls at the attenuator,b,Explanation: Attenuator doesÕt just contain one loop but it can form two in presence of tryptophan and an alternate one in absence of the same for B. subtilis and one terminator and another anti-terminator loops for E. Coli. The other facts about trp operon are absolutely correct.
Question 92,5. Which segments of the attenuator together form the repression loop?,a) Segment 1-2,b) Segment 2-3,c) Segment 3-4,d) Segment 1-4,b,Explanation: In the absence of tryptophan when the RNA polymerase stalls at segment 1 of the attenuator it hinders the formation of loop 1-2. The alternate loop so formed is loop 2-3 which is the attenuation loop.
Question 93,6. We know that lactose has a positive impact on the activity of the lac operon. TryptophanÕs presence has a ________________,a) Positive feedback,b) Negative feedback,c) No difference,d) Highly positive impact,b,"Explanation: Trp binding to the TRAP makes a trp-TRAP complex which binds to the RNA and stabilizes the terminator loop. Hence, TryptophanÕs presence has a negative feedback effect."
Question 94,7. If in an experiment you mutate the two trp codons in the attenuator to ala codon what will be the impact on repression?,a) Repression will be normal,b) Reduced repression,c) No repression so the gene would be constitutively turned on,d) Activation will take place,b,"Explanation: The basis of attenuation at the attenuator is the presence of two trp operon which stalls the RNA polymerase when trp is deficient. Mutating the trp to ala eliminates the attenuatorÕs mode of repression. However, there is still an intrinsic mode of repression by binding of a repressor, which is still active."
Question 95,8. Which of these items have a positive impact on PEDCBA transcription?,a) Trp-TRAP,b) Trp-ANTI TRAP,c) Anti-Trp with TRAP,d) Anti-Trp with Trp-TRAP,d,Explanation: Anti- trp is an auto-regulating molecule that is sensitive to different levels of tryptophan. When tryptophan conc. is high enough to form trp-TRAP complex yet lower than necessary it binds to the Trp-TRAP complex thus preventing repression.
Question 96,9. When uncharged tRNA concentration is low what will you expect as the activity of tryptophan operon?,a) Low,b) Medium,c) High,d) Very high,d,Explanation: When uncharged tRNA concentration is low this is because of lack of trp. This inactivates anti-trap gene and thus there is no attenuation at all in trp gene. Thus activity is high.
Question 97,10. How many stem loop structures play important role in complete system of tryptophan gene regulation?,a) 3,b) 4,c) 6,d) 8,c,Explanation: 3 stem loop for the attenuation and termination in trp gene itself and another 3 for attenuation and termination of anti-trp gene. Overall there are 6 stem loop structures which regulate the entire functioning.
Question 98,11. Which of this mode of trp regulation is not possible in eukaryotes?,a) Anti-TRAP Trp-TRAP,b) Anti-Terminator stabilization,c) Attenuation of trp,d) Trp-TRAP binding,c,Explanation: Attenuation of trp is based on ribosomal stalling at two trp codons which leads to the formation of attenuation loop. This is only possible for co-transcriptional translation which is absent in eukaryotes.
Question 99,12. In which microorganism will you find attenuation by alternate loop formation due to ribosomal stalling?,a) S. aureus,b) E. coli,c) S. typhimurium,d) B. subtlis,d,Explanation: This is a mechanism found in Bacillus subtilis; where other microorganisms like E. coli have a different mechanism. E. coli has the antiÐTRAP trp-TRAP mechanism.
Question 100,13. Which operon behaves similar to Bacillus subtilis trp operon in terms of attenuation?,a) Lac operon,b) His operon,c) Phe operon,d) Ara operon,b,"Explanation: His operon, similar to B. subtilis trp operon, has a streach of 6 His codons in its attenuator which stalls the ribosome and helps in attenuation. "
Question 101,1.  Prokaryotes have 1 RNA polymerase. How many RNA polymerases are there in eukaryotes?,a) 2,b) 3,c) 4,d) None,b,"Explanation: Eukaryotes have three RNA polymerases specialized in different types of RNA transcription. While RNA pol I mainly deals with rRNA, RNA pol II with mRNA and RNA pol III deals with tRNA and 5S rRNA."
Question 102,2. You isolate the nucleolus from the nucleus and performed a density gradient centrifugation with the extract. Then you check the different for the RNA polymerase activity of the different segment. Which RNA polymerase would you expect to find in abundance?,a) RNA pol I,b) RNA pol II,c) RNA pol III,d) RNA pol IV,a,Explanation:  Nucleolus is the centre for rRNA production. As RNA pol I is mainly concerned with rRNA transcription we will expect to find this in abundance. Cytosolic extract on the other hand will be abundant in RNA pol II and III.
Question 103,3. Which RNA polymerase can bind CBP?,a) I,b) II,c) III,d) None,b,"Explanation: CBP or C terminal binding protein binds to the C terminal tail of heptad repeats when it is phosphorylated. As RNA pol II is the only polymerase with a C terminal tail, only RNA pol II will bind the hepad repeat."
Question 104,4. What is the sequence of the heptad repeat of C terminal domain?,a) TSPWSTT,b) YSPTSGS,c) YSPTSPS,d) YSLPSTS,c,"Explanation: A heptad repeat sequence is YSPTSPS where there are 3 phosphoryable serine residues at position 3, 5 and 7."
Question 105,5. You designed an antibody against phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II. Then you use a DNA fragment with lac operon and try to immunoprecipitate the RNA pol II. What will be the expected result?,a) Moderate concentration of RNA pol II will precipitate,b) RNA pol II that precipitated will be contaminated with pol III,c) High amount of RNA pol II will precipitate,d) No RNA pol II will precipitate,d,"Explanation: Lac operon is a prokaryotic gene not recognized by eukaryotic RNA polymerase. Thus it will not be transcribing. Non-Transcribing RNA pol II doesnÕt have phosphorylated residue in CTD, so it canÕt be immunoprecipitated with the given antibody."
Question 106,"6. If you consider a transcribing RNA pol II with a transcript as small as 30 bases, which serine residue in its CTD will be phosphorylated?",a) 2,b) 5,c) 7,d) None,b,Explanation: when RNA transcript is only 30 bases long it is still within the initiation range. Then the 2nd serine residue is phosphorylared only.
Question 107,7. Which factor phosphorylates the serine residues in RNA pol II CTD?,a) TFIIA,b) TFIIB,c) TFIIH,d) TFIID,c,Explanation: TFIIH phosphorylates the serine 2 of the heptad repeat that drives the RNA pol into initiation. The other factors mentioned are only part of pre-initiation complex and not of transcribing RNA pol.
Question 108,8. In what sequence are the serine residues in RNA pol II phosphorylated?,a) 5->2->7,b) 2->5->7,c) 2->7->5,d) 7->2->5,c,"Explanation: The phosphorylation is at the 2nd serine residue with the help of the TFIIH, and then during elongation the phosphorylation is at the 5th serine residue. Between these two there is a short phase of phosphorylation at the 7th serine. "
Question 109,9. In an experiment you add growing concentration of the alpha amanitin. What will be the sequence in which RNA polymerases are affected if at all?,"a) Pol I -> pol III , pol II unaffected",b) pol I->pol I ->pol III,c) pol III->pol II -> pol I,"d) pol II -> pol III , pol I unaffected",d,Explanation: RNA polymerase II is inactivated by very small level of alpha amanitin as low as 1 microgram per ml while on the other hand pol III is affected at 10 micrograms per ml concentration. Polymerase I remain unaffected even at very high alpha amanitin concentration.
Question 110,10. RPA 2 is one of the larger subunits of RNA polymerase in eukaryotes. It is homologous to the prokaryotic _____________,a) Alpha subunit,b) Beta subunit,c) Beta prime subunit,d) Omega subunit,b,Explanation: RPA 2 is homologous to the beta subunit while RPA 1 is homologous to the beta prime subunit which is the catalytic subunit.
Question 111,11. How many of eukaryotic RNA polymerase subunits are common for all three polymerases?,a) 3,b) 5,c) 10,d) 7,b,"Explanation: The beta, beta prime, two alpha and one omega subunit homology to eukaryotic RNA polis common in all three RNA polymerases. These are RPA 1-5 respectively. The rest subunits are non-essential or dispensable."
Question 112,13. In a Drosophila polytene chromosome just before molting you add green labelled antibody against unphosphhorylated RNA pol II CTD and red labelled antibody against phosphorylated RNA pol II CTD. These give fluorescence on adding the respective substrates. What will be the colour in gene 74 EF and 75 B?,a) Red,b) Green,c) Yellow,d) Magenta,a,"Explanation: The 74EF and 75B genes are highly transcribed during and before molting. Thus, there would be many RNA pol II with phosphorylated CTD there which will bind the red labelled antibody. Yellow colour is seen when red and green fluorescence mix."
Question 113,1.  Which of this is a cis binding element?,a) TAF,b) TBP,c) TFIIF,d) TFIIH,b,Explanation: TBP or TATA binding protein is the part of TFIID complex that recognizes and binds the TATA consensus sequence in the promoter (cis element) of eukaryotic genes. The remaining options are also related to eukaryotic transcription but they have protein-protein interactions.
Question 114,2. You wanted to study the assembly of preinitiation complex in eukaryotes. This is by the means of protein-protein interaction. Which of these methods you canÕt absolutely put in use there?,a) Footprinting,b) Crystal structure,c) EMSA,d) Primer extension,d,Explanation: While primer extension method can be used to locate the 5Õ end of the RNA this doesnÕt do any help in studying the assembly of pre initiation complex- basically as thatÕs upstream to even transcription start site. The remaining methods are however very useful.
Question 115,3. For performing EMSA what type of gel should be used?,a) Native,b) Denaturing SDS-PAGE,c) Non-denaturing SDS PAGE,d) Zymography,c,"Explanation: A denaturing SDS PAGE would break the interactions between the factors which is being studied. Thus, a non-denaturing SDS PAGE is used. A native page on the other hand would be less clear while zymography is unrelated."
Question 116,"4. While performing EMSA, in which situation will you see the band highest?","a) You add TFIID, TFIIA and polymerase","b) You add TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIF and polymerase","c) You add TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIF and polymerase","d) You add TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIF and polymerase",b,"Explanation: TFIID is absolutely necessary for any nucleation to take place at all. The complex formed by this composition is almost functional as TFIIA is not playing that important role. However, TFIIB and TFIID absence hugely effects the formation of pre-IC."
Question 117,5. Which of these is not true for TFIIH?,a) It is a helicase,b) On initiation the RNA pol starts transcribing leaving TFIIH at pre-IC,c) It has kinase activity,d) It is needed in Double Strand Break (DSB) repair,b,Explanation: TFIIH is necessary for phosphorylating RNA pol and triggering its initiation. It moves on with the RNA pol after initiation starts. It also acts as a helicase which is put to use during DSB repair. 
Question 118,6. A mediator helps to connect ___________,a) Enhancer to DPE,b) Silencer to Enhancer,c) Enhancer to TAF,d) Insulator to silencer,c,Explanation: As enhancer elements work from a distance the connecting DNA is often looped and the enhancer connects to the RNA pol bound TAF through a mediator. A silencer may connect to TAF in a similar way.
Question 119,7. Which factor stimulated phosphorylation of CTD of RNA polymerase II?,a) TFIIA,b) TFIIF,c) TFIIH,d) TFIIE,d,"Explanation: While TFIIH is actually performing the kinase action, TFIIE stimulates TFIIH to phosphorylate the CTD. TFIIA and TFIIF play no role in phosphorylation."
Question 120,8. The absence of which factor will prevent TFIIH and TFIIE recruitment?,a) F,b) D,c) B,d) A,a,"Explanation: RNA polymerase bound TFIIF is necessary for recruiting TFIIH and TFIIE, two important transcription factors that trigger the initiation finally."
Question 121,9. Which of this is untrue about TBP?,a) It is a part of TFIID,b) It makes a kink in the DNA,c) It is orientation independent,d) It is sequence independent,d,Explanation: TBP specifically recognizes and binds to TATA consensus sequence which makes it sequence dependent. Its correct orientation is however determined by other factors like TFIIA and TFIIB. It makes an 80 kink in the DNA and is a part of TFIID.
Question 122,10. While in vitro transcription your RNA pol is stalled at a position due to mistreatment. Which factor could you act to help the RNA pol overcome the stalled stage?,a) TFIID,b) TFIIF,c) TFIIS,d) TFIIH,c,Explanation: TFIIS is the transcription factor that helps to overcome the transcriptional stalling of RNA polymerases and also to help the polymerase to backtrack.
Question 123,1.  Promoter proximal elements is positioned ________________,a) Outside the core promoter,b) Downstream to start site,c) Within the enhancer,d) Just before the start site,b,Explanation: The promoter proximal elements are a part of the core promoter. They occur downstream to the promoter start site. Enhancers on the other hand are much farther and outside the core promoter.
Question 124,2. TATA box in eukaryotes would be present in _________________,a) Housekeeping genes,b) Developmentally regulated genes,c) Cytoskeletal genes like that for actin,d) Highly specialized genes.,d,Explanation: The highly specialized genes are likely to have a TATA box within their promoter. On the other hand the rest genes have TATAless promoters.
Question 125,3. TFIIB can bind to a promoter element in the core promoter of eukaryotes. This element is __________,a) Inr,b) BRE,c) DPE,d) TATA,b,Explanation: BRE stands for TFIIB recognition site. It is here that the element can bind. On the other hand TFIID binds at the TATA box. 
Question 126,4. Which of these is not a promoter element?,a) TATA box,b) DPE,c) CCAAT box,d) Inr,c,Explanation: The CCAAT box is a part of the upstream activating elements which is upstream to the promoter. It is recognized by CTF or CCAAT recognizing Transcription Factor. The remaining options are part of a core promoter.
Question 127,5. Which would be an appropriate method to detect the core promoter regions in a eukaryotic gene?,a) Footprint,b) Sequencing,c) Linker scanning,d) S1 endonuclease,c,"Explanation: In linker scanning method a small segment of the DNA is removed from promoter region and replaced with a random segment to see its effect on the transcription rate. Thus, as absence of promoter would lead to less transcription this method can be used to detect promoter elements."
Question 128,7. Which of these class III promoter type resemble class II?,a) Type I,b) Type II,c) Type III,d) Type IV,c,"Explanation: The Type III of class III promoter is a non-classical class III promoter which resembles type II. It has a TATA box, PSE and an upstream DSE. There is no 4th type of class III promoter and type I and II donÕt resemble class II."
Question 129,"8. If you make a chimeric factor with the DNA binding element of an activator and a functional domain of a repressor, how will this factor behave?",a) It will act like a repressor,b) It will act like an activator,c) It will not be able to bind the DNA so although it binds via the repressing domain it wonÕt cause repression,d) Repression domain will be non-functional,a,Explanation: As activators and repressors have a domain organization it is seen that if a DNA binding domain is provided it doesnÕt affect the activity. As long as the factor binds to the correct cis element it will still be a functional repressor.
Question 130,9. Which of this element is not orientation independent?,a) Enhancer,b) Silencer,c) Upstream activating element,d) Promoter proximal elements,d,"Explanation: While upstream activating element is orientation independent, enhancers and silencers are position as well as orientation independent. On the other hand promoter proximal elements are orientation dependent."
Question 131,10. Which of these promoter elements has a high propensity of developing mutation given the eukaryotic gene was inserted in prokaryotes?,a) CCAAT box,b) CPG islands,c) TATA box,d) Enhancer,b,"Explanation: This is because prokaryotic methylases would methylate the C bases of the CPG region. Then it there is a de-amination of C base, it will resemble a T base which is not as easily distinguishable as U by UDG. So, this region is very mutagenic."
Question 132,1.  RAP1 has a ___________________,a) Positive effect on transcription,b) No effect on transcription,c) Negative effect on transcription,d) Immensely positive effect on transcription,c,Explanation: RAP1 is necessary for silencing at the telomere. As silenced gene canÕt be expressed so it has a negative effect. The effect can be even called very negative as the silencing is very strong.
Question 133,2. We know that loss of DNA bases is highly mutagenic. But a loss of DNA bases from which region will not have much affect at all?,a) Centromere,b) Satellite region,c) Hot spots for recombination,d) Telomeres,d,"Explanation: Telomere genes are mostly silenced so in case of any deletion mutation the deletion will not be detected. However, loss of bases from anywhere else in the chromosome which transcribe RNA could be disastrous for the cell. "
Question 134,4. Yeast mating factor alpha is located in _________________,a) HMR,b) MAT,c) HML,d) HAT,c,Explanation: The mating factor alpha is located in the left telomere at HML. This gets transferred to MAT locus for expression. HMR has the ÔaÕ mating factor.
Question 135,"5. If a parent yeast is of mating type a, what will be the mating type of its bud?",a) a,b) alpha,c) rho,d) a-alpha,b,"Explanation: In yeast mating type alternates with every generation, so if a parent is ÔaÕ then bud will be ÔalphaÕ and vice versa. Yeast with a-alpha mating type is sterile while there is no rho mating type of yeast."
Question 136,6. Under which condition will the yeast express a-alpha mating type?,a) HAT activation,b) TBP activation,c) HDAC inactivation,d) HAT inactivation,d,Explanation: HAT acetylates the histone H3 and H4 so it activates the gene while HDAC deacetylates them and inactivates the genes. Under condition when HAT is active but HDAC is inactive we will get an expression of both the telomere gene which is normally repressed. This will lead to a-alpha mating type.
Question 137,7.  RAP1 binds to ____________,a) At the loop between enhancer and promoter,b) Linear repeated sequences,c) At the nuclosomes in telomere region,d) Specific sequences at telomere,b,"Explanation: RAP1 has no sequence specification. It binds to the repeated sequences at the telomeric region in the linear DNA lacking nucleosomes. Then, it loops over and spreads the repression to the entire telomere."
Question 138,8. Which of these SIR proteins are having HDAC activity?,a) SIR1,b) SIR2,c) SIR3,d) SIR4,b,Explanation: The SIR or silent information regulator proteins are responsible for repression at the telomere by deacetylating the histones. While SIR3and SIR4 bind to the N-termini the SIR2 protein which is attracted by SIR 3-4 is having the HDAC activity.
Question 139,9. You transfer the DAM gene to the telomere of yeast. What will be your expected result?,a) Methylation at the A sites in specific sequence,b) Methylation at the C sites in specific sequence,c) No methylation at the A sites in specific sequence,d) No methylation at the C sites in specific sequence,c,"Explanation: DAM is a methylase that methylates the A of GATC sequence. When expressed in Yeast it methylated the yeast DNA, however, in telomere the expression is blocked by the telomere silencing effect. Thus, we donÕt get methylated DNA."
Question 140,10. What is the range of telomere suppression?,a) 1kb,b) 3kb,c) 4kb,d) 10kb,c,Explanation: The telomere suppression spreads up to 4kb from the telomere. This is possible due to the looping action of RPA1 and SIR2-4 proteins by protein-protein interactions. The history at this regions are hemi-acetylated.
Question 141,1.  In which of the following chromosome compaction is absent?,a) Cellulomonas flavigena,b) Allium sativum,c) Panthera tigris,d) Saccharomyces cerevisiae,a,"Explanation: Cellulomonas flavigena is a prokaryote, and unlike the rest which are eukaryotes they donÕt have chromosome compaction and histones."
Question 142,2. Histones are __________,a) Neutral,b) Positively charged,c) Negatively charged,d) Neutral with positive and negative domains,b,Explanation: HIstones are rich in positively charged amino acids namely lysine and arginine. Thus they have a net positive charge. This helps them to bind to the negatively charged DNA.
Question 143,3. Which of the following will increase transcription?,a) Shielding positive charge of DNA,b) Shielding positive charge of histones,c) Shielding promoter for polymerase binding,d) Shielding termination region,c,"Explanation: Histone binds to the negatively charged DNA due to its positive charges. On DNA binding those regions of the DNA are not available for transcription. Thus, shielding the positive charge would loosen this binding and enable more transcription."
Question 144,4. Which histone(s) are acted upon by HAT?,"a) H1, H2",b) H3,"c) H2A, H2B","d) H3, H4",d,"Explanation: These are the two histone residues that are having lysine side chains available for acetylation. On, HAT action they loosely bind to DNA allowing transcription."
Question 145,5. In a substrate X catabolic gene promoter you replace the normal histones by your experimental histones Ð ones with arginine side chains in place of histidine. What will be the effect on the concentration of substrate X against the control?,a) Concentration will increase,b) Concentration will decrease,c) Concentration will remain constant,d) Concentration will fluctuate and no definite result will be obtained,c,"Explanation: Arginine side chains canÕt be acetylated, so there is no regulation. They are always positively charged and never bind loosely so no gene product is produced. As these gene products are catabolic in their absence the substance X is not broken down so its concentration remains constant."
Question 146,6. You take a crude cell lysate and treat it with DNase. Now wash it and add protease. Use specific restriction endonuclease to get your desired fragment and run it on a gel. You see a single band. Which of the following will be true about the fragment?,a) It is actively transcribed,b) Only part of it is transcribed,c) No part of it transcribed,d) Undefined transcriptional nature,c,"Explanation: DNase would only get access to uncondensed DNA. Uncondensed DNA is transcriptionally active. As the DNase would have cleaved the fully or partially transcriptionally active DNA, and our fragment is intact, we can say it was not at all being transcribed."
Question 147,7. Which of the following is not a common mode of histone modification in eukaryotes?,a) Methylation,b) Phosphortlation,c) Sulphonation,d) Ubiquitinylation,c,"Explanation: The positively charged N-termini of histone is modified by the phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, methylation and also acetylation processes in order to shield its positive charges."
Question 148,8.  Which of the following association acts as transcriptional activator?,a) Myc- Max,b) Mad- Max,c) Map- Mad,d) MapK- Myc,a,"Explanation: When Max associates with Myc the gene is transcriptionally active, while when Max associates with Mad the gene is inactivated. This is because Mad binds to SIN3A which brings about a HDAC. "
Question 149,"9. In an experiment you perform the following- you attach a flag epitope to HDAC, you over express a mutated Mad1-pro gene within the experimental cell, you immunoprecipitate the protein complex using flag epitope and run that on a non-denaturing SDS PAGE and western blot. Now you add antibodies for HDAC, MAD1 and SIN3A stripping after each addition. What will you observe?",a) Bands at same position every time,b) 3 bands at different positions one at a time,c) Bands at same position on 2 occasions,d) No band,c,Explanation: As Mad1-pro canÕt bind to SIN3A due to the mutation it will not precipitate with the HDAC-SIN3A complex. Due to non-denaturing nature of the gel both the proteins migrate together to the same distance so the band appears at the same position.
Question 150,10. In presence of Thyroid hormone the receptor TR binds to ____________,a) RXR directly,b) mRPD3 directly,c) NcoR directly,d) mRPD3 indirectly,a,"Explanation: In presence of thyroid hormone the receptor binds to RXR directly. In absence however, it binds to NcoR directly, which binds to SIN3 and mRPD3 which is an HDAC, this binding inactivates the genes."
Question 151,1.  If the events in post transcriptional modification are listed as-,       i) Polyadenylation   ii) capping   iii) splicing,What would be the correct sequence?,a) i->ii->iii,b) iii->ii->i,d,"Explanation: Post transcriptional modification is very strictly synchronized process and no next step takes place unless the preceding one is complete. The sequence is 1st adding cap, then Polyadenylation and then splicing."
Question 152,2. Which RNA transcript would be capped by the capping enzymes in vitro mixture of RNA?,a) Pol II transcripts,b) Pol I and Pol III transcripts,c) Pol I transcripts,"d) Pol I, Pol II and Pol III transcripts",d,"Explanation: In vivo, only pol II transcripts are capped, however in vitro when the different pol transcripts are mixed with the capping enzymes all of them are capped showing no specificity."
Question 153,3. Which nucleotide is present in the 5Õ cap?,a) ADP,b) GDP,c) CDP,d) UDP,b,"Explanation: The 5Õ cap has a guanine residue which makes Gpp(pN)n where N is any nucleotide. This is also called the 5Õ G cap. Other bases like A, T, C or U donÕt participate in capping."
Question 154,4. Which is the 1st enzyme in capping?,a) Guanyltransferase,b) RNA 5Õ triphosphatase,c) N7G methytransferase,d) Guanul transferase,d,Explanation: 1st the 5Õ triphosphate group is removed by the phosphatase. Then the Gpp is added to it making it the G cap. Lastly the methyl transferase transfers the methyl group to the N7 position of the cap guanine.
Question 155,6. CBP acts as a(an)_______________,a) Enzyme,b) Adaptor,c) Catalyst,d) Suicide enzyme,c,Explanation: CBP acts as a catalyst which concentrates the enzyme activity at the pol II transcripts so that they are selectively capped at their 5Õ ends.
Question 156,7. In an experiment you try to hybridize a Dna single strand with a mature RNA. You observe loops being formed. These loops have ____________,a) Dna,b) RNA,c) HIstone octamer,d) Histone H1,a,Explanation: Due to splicing the mature mRNA is shorter than the DNA with the introns in DNA looping out when they hybridize. Thus the loops have DNA.
Question 157,8. Which of the following corresponding to the same gene will you expect to be the shortest?,a) DNA,b) hnRNA,c) cDNA,d) mRNA,c,"Explanation: cDNA is made from reverse transcription of mRNA so it lacks the excess modifications present in mRNA. And as mRNA has only exons unlike hnRNA or DNA, cDNA would be the shortest of the four relating to the same gene."
Question 158,9. Splicing concensus sequence is ___________,a) Exon/GUÐintronÐAG/exon,b) Exon/UGÐintronÐAT/exon,c) Exon/GUÐintronÐGA/exon,d) Exon/AUÐintronÐCG/exon,a,"Explanation: It has been seen that splicing occurs at this consensus sequence. However, as there could be many more motief similar to this within the intron there are additional consensus sequences."
Question 159,10. In the consensus sequence 5_-AG/GUAAGUÐintronÐYNCURACÐYnNAG/G-3_  Y could be ______,a) Base A,b) Base G,c) Base C,d) Base T,c,"Explanation: Y could be any pyrimidine that rules out A and G as base. Now we know that RNA doesnÕt have T, so the only pyrimidine possible from the given combination is C."
Question 160,"1.  In an experiment, you are trying to pull down the site where guanyl transferase binds by co-immunoprecipitation. You run a gel and autoradiograph to see a band denoting GSK-RNA pol II (phosphorylated). What will you see when you perform the same experiment with overexpression of GSK in one setup and overexpression of unlabelled GSK-RNA pol II in the other setup?",a) Band is observed in both cases,b) Band in 1st case no band in 2nd,c) No band in 1st case and band in 2nd,d) No band in both cases,a,"Explanation: There will not be any change in the intensity of the 1st band as GT is not binding to GSK tag. The 2nd case also doesnÕt change the intensity of the band as GT binds to phosphorylated ÐGSK-RNA pol II, so no GT bound unlabelled RNA exists to compete with the labeled band and decrease its intensity."
Question 161,2. The poly a tail protects the 3Õ end from____________,a) 5Õ->3Õ exonuclease,b) 3Õ->5Õ exonuclease,c) Translation,d) Export,b,"Explanation: The 3Õ end of the RNA is susceptible to chewing by 3Õ->5Õ exonucleases. So, the poly A tail acts as a safeguard which even if chewed partly will protect the valuable information of the RNA. This in place of inhibition rather promotes the next steps like transcription and export."
Question 162,3. Which of the following mRNA will not be polyadenylated?,a) Actin mRNA,b) Receptor mRNA,c) Canonical histone mRNA,d) Transport channel mRNA,c,"Explanation: Most of the mRNAs are polyadenylated except the major histone mRNAs.

Question 163,4. Which of the box is retained in mature mRNA?,a) TATA box,b) Pribnow box,c) G/U box,d) AU box,d,Explanation: The TATA box and Pribnow box are part of the promoter so they are not even transcribed into RNA. The GU box on the other hand is cleaved off during polyadenylation while the AU box is retained even after polyadenylation.
Question 164,5. Which of these sequences will mark a site of polyadenylation?,a) AAUAAAÑ-GGUUUGUÑÑ-CAÑÑ-,b) UUUGUGUGÑÐCAÑ-AUUAAA,c) AAUAAAÑÐCAÑ-UUUUGUGU,d) CAÑÐAAUAAAÑÑUUUUGUGUGU,c,Explanation: The cleavage sequence has a consensus of AAUAAA sequence towards the 5Õ and a G/U box towards the 3Õ end and a CA dinucleotide in the middle. The cleavage is just after 3Õ to the CA.
Question 165,6. Which of the following does not directly interact with DNA?,a) CPSF,b) CStF,c) PABPII,d) PAP,d,"Explanation: PAP binds to CPSF and CStF by protein-protein interaction and doesnÕt actually bind to the DNA. However, the other factors are cis elements binding to specific sequences."
Question 166,7. CPSF and CStF bind to ____________,a) AAUAAA and G/U box respectively and bind is very strong,b) G/U box and AAUAAA respectively and bind is very strong,c) G/U box strongly but weakly AAUAAA,d) AAUAAA weakly but stabilization occurs after G/U binding,d,Explanation: CPSF binds to AAUAAA but the interaction is weak. This interaction is strengthened by CStF binding to G/U box and further stabilization occurs at CFI and CFII binding.
Question 167,8. PAP has a processivity of ___________,a) 5-10 bases,b) 10-20 bases,c) 50-100 bases,d) 100-250 bases,b,Explanation: PAP has a very low processivity of about 10-20 A bases before binding of PABP II which has a very high processivity of 100 to 250 poly A bases.
Question 168,9. Which experimental method can you use to detect 3Õ end processing?,a) CHIP,b) Affinity chromatography,c) Northern blot,d) Immunofluorescence,b,Explanation: An affinity chromatography using oligo T sephadex beads in the column can be used to detect proper 3Õ processing.

Question 169,1.  IN case of splicing the attacking group is _________________,a) ATP,b) GTP,c) A,d) G,c,Explanation: Splicing requires a branch point A that can attach the 5Õ end with the intron making a lariat structure. This doesnÕt require energy molecules like ATP.
Question 170,"2. In the case of group 1 RNA, which one of the following canÕt attack?",a) GMP,b) GDP,c) GTP,d) ATP,d,"Explanation: It is seen that in the case of group II auto splicing RNA the attack is made by the 3Õ-OH end of the ribose attached to the G base. It is immaterial whether its GMP, GDP or GTP. However, A base is not seen to attack in that case."
Question 171,4. Choose the wrong answer.,a) The A base saves the 5Õ-P of the intron by forming bond which saves requirement of ATP,b) The 5Õ-P attacks the 3Õ-OH of the intron,c) In self splicing group I G base makes this lariet structure,d) Group II self-splicing RNA splices better when proteins are added,c,"Explanation: The G base attacking the 5Õ end of the intron doesnÕt form a bond with the 2ÕOH but with the 3Õ-OH end. Thus, in place of a leriet like structure a linear structure is seen."
Question 172,5. Which of the following shows incorrect matching?,a) Group I : G base,b) U1 : Exon,c) U2AF : U2,d) U6 : U2,d,Explanation: In the spliceosome complex we see that U1 is replaced by U6 and not U2. U2AF on the other hand is replaced by U2. Other matches but d are correct.
Question 173,6. 5Õ______ and 3Õ ____ is the sequence for two ends of an intron.,a) GA TC,b) GU AG,c) AG TA,d) GA AT,b,"Explanation: The 5Õ end of the splice site has the sequence GU, the 3Õ end has the sequence AG. These help to locate the intron but more determining factors exist."

Question 180,14. ESE bound to SR proteins ______________ splicing and ESE bound to hnRNA ______________ splicing.,"a) Activate, activate","b) Activate, inactivate","c) Inactivate, activate","d) Inactivate, inactivate",b,"Explanation: Binding of SR proteins to ESE or exon splicing enhancers promotes splicing where that exon is retained. hnRNA is a competitive inhibitor of SR proteins that tend to bind ESE as well, thus it inactivates."
Question 181,15. U rich RNA that helps in splicing are______________,a) sn RNA,b) snoRNA,c) hnRNA,d) mRNA,a,Explanation: The U rich NA are the small nuclear or snRNA. The snoRNA are needed for ribosomal rRNA processing in the nucleolus. hnRNA is heterogeneous nuclear RNA are mRNA is the RNA that is spliced by snRNA.
Question 182,1. Which of the following codon calls for fMettRNA ÐfMet?,a) CTA,b) GUA,c) AUG,d) AUA,c,"Explanation: AUG is the start codon for translation, and it incorporates formyl methinonyl tRNA to start translation. The 1st base is always an f-Met although it may be later cleaved off."

What is meant by degenerate codon?,a) Two codons can be read in different frame o give different amino acids,b) Codons are not having a gap,c) Specific codon codes for specific amino acid,d) Two codons can code for same amino acid,d,Explanation: Degeneracy means that there can be two or more codons that can code for same amino acid with there being triplet codon and 4 bases there are 64 possible combinations and only 20 amino acids. This was then observed that different codon could be degenerate i.e. code for same amino acid.
Question 184,4. Consider that our codon in place of being triplet was quadruplet. How many possible combinations could be there then?,a) 64,b) 128,c) 256,d) 360,c,Explanation: There are 4 DNA bases and triplet coodon so number of possible combinations id 43=64.

Question 189,10. Which of these mutations will have the least harmful effect?,a) Addition of 2 bases,b) Deletion of 3 bases,c) Transition of one base,d) Deletion of a chunk,c,Explanation: In all possibilities transition of a base would have least harmful effect as there are degenerate codons for same amino acid. The new codon could thus be a silent mutation. Also if it is the 3rd base due to wooble hypothesis it will have negligible effect.
Question 190,"11. If you charge a lys-tRNA with an alanine, what amino acid will you expect to be incorporated against AAA?",a) Lysine,b) Alanine,c) Phenylalanine,d) f-alanine,b,"Explanation: The anticodon loop plays no part in recognizing the amino acid.

Question 213,2. Puromycin is a ribosomal antibiotic. It binds to ________,a) Peptide exit channel,b) 16S rRNA,c) tRNA binding site,d) A site of unassociated 16S rRNA,c,Explanation: Puromycinis a tRNA analogue that has an amide bond in place of ester bond. This is why when the ribosome transfers the peptide over this; it flees with the peptide and stops the translation.
Question 214,3. In an experiment you add rifampicin and paramomycin to the ribosome and mRNA mixture. What will inhibit theribosomal translation efficiency and how?,a) Rifampicin will prevent translation initiation,b) Paramomycin will slow down translation,c) Rifampicin will bind irreversibly to the ribosome and inactivate it,d) Paramomycin will increase error rate,d,Explanation: Paramomycin acts as a ribosomal translation inhibitor while Rifampicin acts on RNA polymerase.

Question 226,8. What is the distance between the catalytic site and the nearest protein in the ribosome?,a) No distance,b) 10 angestron,c) 50 angestron,d) 100 angestron,c,Explanation: There is a gap of 50 angestron between the catalytic site of the ribosome and the nearest protein to that point. This ensures that the catalytic activity is due to the rRNA and not any protein as proteins canÕt influence a reaction 50 angestron away from it.
Question 227,10. Aminoglycosides can kill_______________,a) Broad spectrum of prokaryotes,b) Only gram positive bacteria,c) Only anerobic gram positive bacteria,d) Only aerobic gram negative bacteria,d,"Explanation: Aminoglycosides are the group of antibiotic that can kill gram negative bacteria which are aerobic.

Thus, it will prevent new initiation but will not halt already translating ribosomes."
Question 231,3. IF1 helps in correct placement of the initiation tRNA. How does it do so?,a) By guiding it to P site,b) By binding to A site,c) By dissociating the ribosomal complex,d) By binding to the P site,b,Explanation: IF1 binds to the A site of the 30S subunit so that the 1st aminoacyl-tRNA canÕt sit at the A site. It then sits on the P site i.e. correct position.
Question 232,4. Which initiation factor prevents association of ribosome when not bound to mRNA?,a) IF1,b) IF2,c) IF3,d) IF4,c,Explanation: The IF3 binds to the 30S subunit and prevents association of 30S and 50S subunit when the ribosome is not bound to mRNA. It also helps in binding t the mRNA.
Question 233,5. If you see a GTP bound IF2 it is _________,a) Before initiation,b) During initiation,c) After initiation,d) Not related to an initiation,a,Explanation: IF2 guides the 1st tRNA to the P site of the ribosome.

Question 235,7. What is used to regulate translation initiation in eukaryotes?,a) Turnover of mRNA,b) Ubiquitination of ribosome,c) Phosphorylation of IF2,d) Methylation of IF1a,c,"Explanation: Phosphorylation of IF2 prevents it from binding to f-MettRNA-f-Met, thus it prevents initiation of translation by IF2 bringing the 1st amino acid."
Question 236,8. If you compare the Kozak sequence with the SD sequence of the prokaryotes which is located at the greater distance from the start site?,a) Equal distance,b) Kozak,c) Shine and Dalgarno sequence,d) Both are too far to account,c,Explanation: Eukaryotes are not polycistronic and the 5Õ cap corresponds to the 5Õ end of the mRNA near which it must start translating. Although there is not much defined sequence but all the same there is a consensus.

Which of the bases are important in detecting whether the AUG should be the start site for eukaryotic initiation?,a) -2 and +3,b) -4 and +3,c) -3 and +4,d) -1 and +4,c,"Explanation: The consensus sequence CC(A/G)CCAUGG was discovered by Kozak, where the purine in -3 and +4 position is significant in determining which AUG should serve as initiation site."
Question 238,"10. If give a segment Ð 5ÕCTGACCAUGGCCTAGAUGCCTCT, which AUG will the eukaryotic ribosome choose as initiation site?",a) Any at random,b) First,c) Second,d) None,b,"Explanation: The ribosome scans the mRNA from 5Õ end to the 3Õ end searching for a Kozak consensus sequence to start at. Here, the 1st AUG indeed has a purin at -3 and +4 position so it is a good initiation site, the ribosome will not look beyond to the 2nd AUG(weaker) and start initiation. "
Question 239,1. Which initiation factor in eukaryotes recognizes the 7-M-G cap?,a) eIF4G,b) eIF4B,c) eIF4E,d) eIF4A1,c,Explanation: eIF4E recognized the 7-Methyl Guanine cap in the 5Õ end of mRNA.

Question 243,5. Which poly a tail binding protein helps in the initiation of translation?,a) CPSF,b) PAP,c) PABP1,d) PABP2,d,Explanation: PABP2 can bind the poly a tail to the eIF4E through the mediator eIF4G. This increases the association of the 40S subunit to the 5Õ end of the mRNA thus increasing translation.
Question 244,6. Which of the following is not a part of eIF4F complex?,a) eIF4A,b) eIF4B,c) eIF4E,d) eIF4G,b,"Explanation: eIF4F is the complex that assembles at the 5Õ methylated guanine cap of the mRNA to initiate translation.

Question 248,10. Which of the following is done by HCR?,a) Phosphorylation of eIF4E-BP,b) Phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha,c) Dephosphorylation of eIF4E-BP,d) Dephosphorylation of eIF2-Alpha,b,Explanation: HCR is Heme Controlled Repressor protein which senses the lack of heme in the medium and phosphorylated eIF2-alpha. This prevents the GEF activity of eIF2B and prevents translation. This measure prevents the waste of resources. 
Question 249,1.  Which of the elongation factor binds to amino acyl tRNA?,a) Ef-Tu,b) Ef-Ts,c) Ef-G,d) GDP,a,"Explanation: EF-Tu in GTP bound form binds to amino acyl tRNA. It helps to bring the amino acid to the ribosome, and one placed in proper position the GTP hydrolyses."

Question 272,4. In a synergistic model of initiation which of the following factor doesnÕt directly lead to initiation?,a) eIF4E,b) PAB1,c) eIF4G,d) Protein X,d,"Explanation: In a synergistic model of initiation both the poly a tail and the G cap plays a role. So, PAB1 binds to the poly A tail and eIF4E binds to the 5Õ-G cap with the eIF4G acting as a linker. But protein X plays a role in IRES mode of initiation not this."
Question 273,"5. When the intracellular iron level is low, the turnover of transferrin mRNA is________",a) Increased,b) Decreased,c) Kept normal,d) DoesnÕt effect,b,"Explanation: By turnover of mRNA the effective concentration of a protein can be decreased as it reduces the chance of translation. When already the level of iron is low, more transferring s required, so mRNA is stabilized and its turnover is reduced."

This reduction is due to_____________,a) Binding of eIF4E by PHAS 1,b) Greater turnover of mRNA for casein,c) Lesser synthesis of casein mRNA,d) Development of secondary structure on mRNA preventing translation,b,"Explanation: It has been seen in vitro that treatment with prolactin only increases the production of casein mRNA to 3 fold, but there is an increase of 100 fold in casein level. So, this must be due to an increase in stability by the change in protein turnover rate."
Question 275,"7. In an experiment if you take a stretch of hybridized RNA, and add only eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4a and eIF4B together what will happen to the band obtained by that fragment under SDS.","a) Slight rise, no rise, appearance of two bands one on top of original",b) No rise in all cases but appearance of a 2nd band on top of 1st in 3rd case,"c) Slight rise, slightly more rise, and highest rise","d) A faint band above the original, only original and a dark band above original",d,Explanation: Rise in a band is seen only in case of EMSA which is not performed in this experiment. Here eIF4A acts as a helicase separating the dimer into monomer which leads to the formation of an upper band. eIF4B is a promoter of helicase activity of eIF4A in absence of which there is only slight activity.
Question 276,8. Translation of which sigma factor is dependent on a genetic thermostat?,a) Sigma 70,b) Sigma 32,c) Sigma E,d) Sigma S,b,"Explanation: When the temperature is favorable the sigma 32 gene is hidden from initiation by complex mRNA structure.

Question 362,"7. In an experiment you introduce your gene of interest in a wild type E. cloli genome using an episome. However, you fail to see the product protein being formed. What could be the possible reason for this?",a) The gene was silenced,b) The gene product was produced in negligible quantity,c) The bacteria was in stress so it was not producing much protein,d) The gene was excised out,d,"Explanation: While all the reasons stand a possibility of being true, under the experimental condition it might be due to the restriction enzyme cleaving out GOI considering it a virus. Thus, the E. coli strains need to be restriction deficient but methylation proficient."
Question 363,8.  Which of the following enzyme air is a neoisoschizomer?,a) SphI and BbuI,b) Not1 and HindIII,c) SmaI and XmaI,d) Pst1 and Sma1,c,"Explanation: Neo-isoschizomers are the enzymes that recognize the same sequence and cleave at different points. Here, both Sma1 and Xma1 recognize GGGCCC; the 1st cleaving after the 3rd G and 2nd cleaving after the 1st."
Question 364,9. Which of these restriction enzymes generate 3Õ overhang?,a) Sph1,b) EcoR1,c) Sma1,d) Xma1,a,"Explanation: Sph1 recognized the sequence AGTAC/G, as it cleaves near the 3Õ end of the sequence it generates an asymmetric cut with 3Õ overhang. While Sma1 produces a blunt end and Xma1 and EcoR1 produces a 5Õ overhang."
Question 365,10. Restriction enzymes cleave the bond by which type of reaction?,a) SN1,b) SN2,c) SE1,d) SE2,b,Explanation: The reaction is by hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond between two sugar residues by a nucleophilic attack. Inverted product configuration shows that the substrate was inverted only once. As only bimolecular nucleophilic reaction causes only one time inversion so that is the correct option.
Question 366,11. The Mg2+ ion in restriction endonuclease is not bound to ________,a) Water molecule,b) Carboxylates of the enzymes aspertate group,c) Oxygen,d) Histidine,d,Explanation: In restriction endonucleases we donÕt have His as a ligand to the central metal ion Mg2+. While itÕs binding to the other groups assists in the nucleophilic attack.
Question 367,12. In EcoRV the enzyme is a ____________,a) Homo dimer,b) Hetero dimer,c) Trimer,d) Hetero tetramer,a,"Explanation: As the enzyme recognizes the palindrome sequences, the homodimer would be able to recognize the same sequence from the other end. Thus, restriction endonucleases are homodimers."
Question 368,"13. When the DNA enzyme interacts with the cognate DNA, there is _______________",a) Increase in free energy,b) Reduction in free energy,c) Breakdown of the complex,d) Repulsion,b,Explanation: On restriction endonuclease binding to cognate DNA there is a reduction in free energy to a greater extent than that in case of non-cognate DNA. This additional energy is used to distort the sequence and produce a kink.
Question 369,14. Methylated DNA doesnÕt form kink as________________,a) As they donÕt fit in the active site,b) The enzyme recognized methylated A as different base than non-methylated A,c) They are less flexible so no kink is formed,d) They donÕt interact with the side chains in an active site,d,"Explanation: The kink in the DNA is formed not by just the recognition of the base sequence in the restriction site, but also by the interactions of the side chains. Asp 185 is unable to interact with methylated A, so no kink is formed."
Question 370,1.  In which of the following will you expect plasmids to be absent?,a) Streptococcus sp,b) Schizosaccharomyces pombe,c) Panthera sp,d) Haemophilis sp,c,Explanation: Among the following options only prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes like yeast can have plasmids. So option a and d being prokaryote and b being yeast has plasmid. But option c being higher eukaryote i.e. the genus of tiger lacks plasmids.
Question 371,2.  Which of the following is not true about plasmids?,a) They are extrachromosomal DNA,b) They are double stranded,c) They confer antibiotic resistance,d) They may get incorporated in chromosome,d,"Explanation: Plasmids generally donÕt get incorporated in a chromosome; if it does so then it is known as episome not plasmids. It is true that plasmids are circular, double stranded, extrachromosomal DNA that can confer antibiotic resistance."
Question 372,3. Which class of plasmids assists in the production of bacteriocins?,a) F plasmid,b) FÕ plasmid,c) R plasmid,d) Col plasmid,d,Explanation: Col plasmids help in the production of cilicins and bacteriocins. This helps them to kill other bacteria. While F plasmids confer fertility and R confers resistance to some antibiotics.
Question 373,4. Which of the following is not a part of RTF?,a) Origin of replication,b) Chloranphemicol resistance,c) Origin of transfer,d) Pilli forming gene,b,"Explanation: The R agent class of plasmids consists of Resistance transfer factor RTF as well as Resistance gene R. While the origin of replication and transfer, and pilli forming gene are part of RTF; antibiotic resistance gene such as Chloramphenicol resistance gene is part of R."
Question 374,5. In an experiment you want to express your gene of interest in a prokaryote through a plasmid. What would be your ideal copy number?,a) 2 or 3,b) 10,c) 80,d) 100,a,"Explanation: The gene of interest by us should always be expressed in low copy number as if it is in higher copy number t will use more of bacterial recourses without helping them at all. So, bacteria might then dispense some of these chromosomes."
Question 375,7. Which of the following antibiotic resistance is through alteration of uptake?,a) Streptimycin,b) Chloramphenicol,c) Tetracyclin,d) Rifampicin,c,Explanation: Tetracyclin resistance is provided by some transporters that selectively transport tetracycline outside the cell thus providing resistance; whereas the other antibiotics are through other modes of resistance.
Question 376,8. Which of the following plasmids fir the definition of episomes?,a) F factors,b) R factors,c) Col factors,d) RTF factors,a,Explanation: Episomes are the plasmids that can get incorporated in a central chromosome. F factors or fertility factor is one such plasmid.
Question 377,9.  Streptomycin resistance is conferred by______________,a) Modification of antibiotic,b) Modification of target,c) Modification of uptake,d) Using different insensitive pathway,b,"Explanation: Streptomycin resistance is through the modification of the target i.e. Ribosome, so that it can no longer interact with streptomycin in the same way."
Question 378,10. Bacteriocins are _______________,a) Toxic nucleic acids,b) Non-ribosomally synthesized toxic proteins,c) Ribosomally synthesized toxic proteins,d) Modified normal proteins,c,Explanation: Bacterocins are ribosomally synthesized proteins or peptides that are not toxic to the producer but to the other bacteria around it.
Question 379,11. Bacteriocins are produced by bacteria in __________,a) Lag phase,b) Log phase,c) Transition phase,d) S phase,d,Explanation: In the S phase there is a lot of competition between the bacterias for space and resources. Bacteriocins are used to kill off the bacterias of same species or related bacteria to resuce the competition.
Question 380,12. What is the general target of bacteriocins?,a) Nuclei,b) Plasma mambrane,c) Cell wall,d) ECM,c,Explanation: Bacteriocins have proteolytic and amylolytic enzymes that can digest the cell wall and kill the bacteria. It generally doesnÕt target anything else.
Question 381,1.  Conjugation canÕt take place between_________________,a) F- and F+,b) FÕ and F-,c) HFR and F-,d) HFR and F+,d,Explanation: For conjugation to take place one bacterium must have the F plasmid and other should lack it. HFR has the components of F plasmid within its genome so it canÕt mate with another F+.
Question 382,"2. In an experiment you have met, bio, thr+ and leu + bacterial strain in test tube 1; and met+, bio+, thr and leu bacterial strain in other test tube 2. Which of the following will not comply with your experimental results?",a) Both the strains will grow in enriched media,b) 2nd strain will grow in met absent media,c) Mixture of two strains will grow in minimal media,d) 1st stain will not grow in leu absent media,d,"Explanation: In this case, the 1st strain will have the ability to make leu as it is leu+. So it can grow in leu+ media. The ability of the mixture to grow in minimal media is due to the fact that gene transfer has taken place."
Question 383,3. In case of mixing his+ leu- strain with his- leu+ strain we can see that the auxotroph behaves as prototroph for these two genes. This is because of________________,a) One is synthesizing one amino acid and giving it to the other type,b) They fuse to form similar diploid bacteria,c) Both will have the same genetic composition at the end,d) They share the RNA by extracellular processes,c,"Explanation: Genetic transfer, mainly by conjugation will result in incorporation of the His+ Leu+ gene in both the strains at the end. Then they can produce both these amino acids by themselves and grow on minimal media. This is not by extracellular process but by contact."
Question 384,4. Which gene in a plasmid is indispensible for it to participate in conjugation?,a) Pilli forming gene,b) Origin of replication,c) Sex determining gene,d) Origin of transfer,c,"Explanation: There is no particular sex determining gene in bacteria, their pseudo sex is determined by presence or absence f fertility factor. However pilli forming gene is necessary for the conjugation channel, ori of transfer and ori of replication also maintain a plasmid."
Question 385,5. Which of the following can transfer the genes in bacterial nucleoid as well?,a) F- plasmid,b) R factor,c) FÕ plasmid,d) HFR,d,"Explanation: While FÕ can transfer one or two of the bacterial gene as well, but only HFR can transfer the gene from the nucleoid of the bacteria as it is the F plasmid incorporated in the central chromosome."
Question 386,6. A HFR bacteria mates with an F- plasmid containing bacteria. What will be the type of bacteria after conjugation is complete?,a) F+,b) F-,c) FÕ,d) HFR,b,Explanation: In HFR rarely the complete chromosome can be transferred from one bacterium to other due to the continuous motion of the medium. Here only partially the genes from Ori of transfer till the point where conjugation channel is broken gets transferred. As the full F plasmid can thus never be transferred so it is F-.
Question 387,"8. In and interrupted mating experiment, it is seem that the after 10 mins AziR gene in recipient, after 20 minuites there is appearance of tonR  and after 15 mins the recipient is lac+ , but the recipient is almost never his+.  Where in the genome is the ori of transfer?",a) Between AziR and TonR genes,b) Between TonR and Lac+,c) Between Lac+ and His+,d) Between His+ and AziR,d,"Explanation: As the origin of transfer is between His+ and AziR the sequence follows AziR, ->TonR->Lac+->His+ or the reverse direction. Thus, longer time is required for His to enter and in most cases before that the conjugation tube breaks."
Question 388,"10. In an experiment of determining the order of gene in bacteria we use HFR which is gal+, Lac+, Ara+ and His+. If the recipient is negative for all these genes, and we selectively choose Gal + and get the pattern-",100 % recipients are Gal +,30% are His+,55% are Lac +,And only 5% are Ara+,a,Explanation: While the HFR could incorporate in different positions by selecting one gene we are setting a start site for checking. Now the gene order agrees with the percent incorporation as the farther genes have a lower probability of incorporation.
Question 389,"11. For complete HFR to enter the recipient, how much time should the two bacterial cells be in contact?",a) 10 mins,b) 30 mins,c) 60 mins,d) 100 mins,d,"Explanation: The two participating bacteria taking part in conjugation should actually stay connected by conjugation tube for 100 minutes for the entire chromosome i.e. HFR to get transferred. However, as they are constantly in motion such occurrence is rare."
Question 390,"1. In an experiment you have a U-Tube with two strains of bacteria in two arms. In one arm the bacteria are Gal+ and His-, in other the strain is Gal- and His+. If the two arms are joined by a membrane that doesnÕt allow bacterial cells to pass to opposite site what will you observe when you plate each arm bacterial strain on minimal media?",a) None will grow,b) Some colonies seen in right arm,c) Some colonies seen in left arm,d) Some colonies seen in both arms,d,Explanation: Here the transfer of gene is mainly due to transformation. Although the bacterial cells couldnÕt come in physical contact yet their nucleic acids could flow with the liquid to other arm and it can be incorporated by the bacterial cells in the other arm.
Question 391,3. If the genes order in bacteria is His gal met. Which of the following genes have the least probability of getting incorporated alone?,a) All have equal probability,b) Met,c) Gal,d) His,c,Explanation: Gal can be incorporated alone only by the event of double cross over. Double crossover at such short stretch is of least occurrence so the probability of it being incorporated alone is least.
Question 392,4. Which of the following species has natural competence?,a) Saccharomyces cerevisiae,b) Staphylococcus Aeruginosa,c) Gelidium corneum,d) Streptococcus pneumoniae,d,"Explanation: Only 1% of all the bacterial strains are naturally competent. One among these is Streptococcus pneumonia, which can take up the chromosomes from the medium without prior treatment."
Question 393,5. Competence can be generated in some strains of non-competent bacteria by __________,a) Treating then with Chitinase,b) By treating them with penicillin,c) By electroporation,d) By pentrifugation,c,Explanation: Electroporation is a technique where a short pulse f electricity is used to induce artificial competence in some cells. Treating with chitinase or penicillin will severely affect the cell wall and the cells will die.
Question 394,7. What is the minimum length of DNA fragment in exogenote required for incorporation of the gene in the endogenote?,a) 50bp,b) 250bp,c) 400bp,d) 500bp,d,"Explanation: Although very small fragments of DNA are taken up by the cell, a minimum of 500bp is necessary for recombinational machinery to act on, thus for incorporation."
Question 395,8. If the probability of incorporation of a gene A from a bacterial cell that has lysed in the medium is a. And the probability of incorporation of another gene B from the same bacteria that has lysed is b. What is the probability of one recipient receiving both?,a) a+b,b) a-b,c) a X b,d) a/b,c,"Explanation: For both genes to be incorporated together we must multiply the probability of incorporation of either genes. Thus, the probability value overall decreases."
Question 396,9. Probability of incorporation of a gene P is 0.2 and the probability of incorporation of another gene is 0.1. The probability of both being incorporated is seen experimentally to be equal to 0.1. What is our inference?,a) Both the genes are incorporated randomly,b) The genes are linked,c) The bacteria has a preference for the two gene,d) It was just an artifact,b,Explanation: The probability of incorporation of both should be theoretically 0.2X0.1= 0.02. But experimentally it is found to be 0.1 which is the same as that of 2nd gene. Thus these genes are completely linked i.e. whenever b is incorporated a is incorporated as well.
Question 397,"10. If co-incorporation probabilities are given as p,o 0.1; o,r 0.02 ; p,r 0.15. What is the gene order",a) o r p,b) o p r,c) r o p,d) CanÕt be determined due to insufficient data,b,"Explanation: This is because o and p have an appreciable degree of co-incorporation, as does r and p but o and r have much lower degree of co-incorporation. This shows that p must be at the middle of o and r. "
Question 398,1.  Which of the following viruses will be useful for transduction?,a) T2 phage,b) T4 phage,c) T7 phage,d) Lamda phage,d,"Explanation: T phages mainly undergo lytic cell cycle, while lamda phages have lysogenic cell cycle. For transduction to occur, the viral genome must integrate within the nucleoid else it will never incorporate bacterial gene within itself. Thus, only lamda phage will be able to help in transduction."
Question 399,2. What is the capacity of viral gene storage termed as?,a) Viral capacity,b) Tight head capacity,c) Head full capacity,d) Virulent capacity,c,"Explanation: The viral head has a specific capacity to load Nucleic acid. This capacity can be satisfied by only viral genome, a combination of viral and bacterial genome or only bacterial genome. This is called head full capacity."
Question 400,"3. In a transduction experiment where the recipient is Met-, Ala-, Gal- you observe a recombinant phenotype Met+, Gal+ in some strains and Gal+ Ala+ in some strains. But in none of the cases can you find Met+ Ala+. What is the sequence of the gene?","a) Met, Ala, Gal","b) Met, Gal, Ala","c) Gal, Met, Ala","d) Gal, Ala, Met",b,Explanation: The recombinant genotype Met+ Ala+ will only result in the case when there is a double cross over such that the middle portion is exchanged twice. This is of least occurrence and is deterministic for the sequence.
Question 401,"4. You are checking the sequence of 3 genes using generalized transduction mapping. The recipient is Leu-,  AziS, Thr- while the donor is Leu+,  AziR, Thr +. If you select the Leu+ as marker,  AziR would be 50% while Thr+ would be 2%. If you select Thr+ as marker Leu+ would be 3% and AziR would be 0%. What is the sequence?",a) Thr Leu Azi,b) Azi Thr Leu,c) Azi Leu Thr,d) Thr Azi Leu,a,Explanation: Genes Leu and Azi and genes Leu and Thr have a tendency to be incorporated together; this is as a result of their physical proximity. On the other hand Thr and azi hardy show such tendency so they must be farther apart. This results in the sequence with Leu in the middle.
Question 402,5. Which of the following is not true for specialized transduction?,a) The lysogenic viruses can perform this,b) A variety of genes can be transformed in this case,c) The viral genome is then incorporated in the bacterial genome,d) It is seen in lamda phage like K12,b,Explanation: Here the viral genome is actually incorporated in the bacterial genome at a particular site. The virus can transfer the gene surrounding its recombination site only. It is certainly through lusogenic cycle which is seen in lamda phages including K12.
Question 403,6. The Phage is incorporated in the bacterial genome by _____________________,a) Single crossover event,b) Two crossover event,c) Three point recombination,d) 4 crossover event,a,Explanation: A viral genome is introduced in bacteria as a circular plasmid. It will be incorporated by a single cross over between the att site of virus and the att Lamda site of bacteria.
Question 404,7. Which of these is correct according to transduction?,a) Specialized transduction is due to excision error,b) FÕ plasmid can act in specialized transduction,c) Only specialized transduction in virus can be used to cause genetic variations,d) Bacteriophage nucleic acid is dispensable for virulence,a,Explanation: When the Lysigenic virus enters Lytic cycle its gene has to excise out of the bacterial genome. Imperfections in this excision can cause excision of a part of bacterial genome along with the circular viral genes. This results in specialized transduction.
Question 405,"8. If the bacterial DNA sequence is Leu Met Att Gal Bio, which of the genes can be transferred via specialized transduction?",a) Leu and Met,"b) Met, Att and Gal",c) Gal and Bio,d) Met and Gal only,d,Explanation: Att site is merely necessary for incorporation of the virus. In specialized transduction the sites directly beside the attachment point of the virus can be mistakenly excised with the part of viral gene. Here this phenomenon will occur only in case of Met and Gal.
Question 406,9. A specialized transducing virus attacks a healthy bacterial cell. What will be the virulence of the viruses produced by this bacterial cell after infection?,a) They will me more virulent than original one,b) They will be equally virulent as original one,c) The virulence will depreciate,d) No virulence,d,"Explanation: This is because some part of the viral genome is compromised for this improper excision making it specialized transducing phage. Without the complete viral genome, the resultant viruses will not be able to express their infective activity."
Question 407,10. In which of the following cases will the viral progeny generated retain their infection ability?,a) A generalized trasducing phage affects a normal cell,b) A specialized transducing phage affects a cell infected by same virus,c) A specialized transducing phage will attack a normal cell,d) A generalized transducing phage will affect a cell with a different viral infection,b,Explanation: When the recipient is already infected by the same virus the complete genome of specialized tranducing phage is already present. This will produce normal infective virus as well as more specialized transducing infective viruses.
Question 408,11. A specialized transducing phage attacking an infected cell with lysogenic stage of the same virus gives rise to________,a) HFR,b) HFT,c) FÕ,d) F,b,Explanation: Hft or High frequency transducing viruses has a greater tendency to produce specialized transducing phage by improper excision event as they are very unstable. HFR occurs by integration of F plasmid after conjugation.
Question 409,12. The recombination study of phages is done using ____________,a) OD measurement,b) Plaque assay,c) Plating assay,d) Boyden chamber assay,b,Explanation: In Plaque assay bacterial culture is grown in a plate and then it is infected by the viruses. The plaque so formed by the viruses is studies to categorize the morphological features and study the recombination.
Question 410,2. Linkage ________ as the distance between two genes ______________,"a) Decreases, decreases","b) Unaffected, Decreases","c) Decreases, Increases","d) Increases, Increases",c,"Explanation: As the distance between the two gens increase, the probability of recombination event occurring between then is higher. Thus, linkage increases as the distance between two genes decrease and vice-versa."
Question 411,3. In Drosophila males there is complete linkage. What is the reason behind this?,a) The genes are very closely located,b) Coupling theory,c) No synapsis,d) Unknown reason,c,"Explanation: In Drosophila male these is no formation of synaptonemal complex, hence no synapsis is the pachytene phase of meiosis I. As there is no synapsis, there is no recombination."
Question 412,4. Linkage results in __________,a) Formation of more Dominant phenotype,b) Formation of more Wild phenotype,c) Formation of more parental phenotype,d) Formation of more recombinant phenotype,c,"Explanation: Linkage prevents recombination, thus it results in the formation of more parental phenotypes and lesser wild phenotypes. But it is not determining dominant/recessive traits or wild/mutant trait as that depends on genetic constitution of the parent."
Question 413,"5. If you suddenly observe linkage between two genes that are present in two chromosomes, this can be due to __________________",a) Coupling,b) Translocation,c) Inversion,d) Non-homologous end joining,b,Explanation: Translocation of a gene from one chromosome to another within the same genome will result in then being on same chromosome. Then they can show linkage relationship.
Question 414,6. Accurate mapping of genes can be done using _______,a) Two point mapping,b) Three point mapping,c) Single gene mapping,d) None of the mentioned,b,Explanation: When the distance between two genes is quite large there is increases possibility of double recombination event occurring between them. This can be avoided by 3 point mapping.
Question 415,7. Recombination occurs in _________,a) Single strand stage,b) Two strand stage,c) Three strand stage,d) Four stand stage,d,Explanation: The only possibilities in this case are recombination in 2 strands and 4 strand stage. The study of recombinants show that recombination at 2 stand stage will produce effectively the same combination as in the absence of recombination. Thus it must be in the 4 strand stage.
Question 416,"8. Double crossovers can involve two, three or four strands at a time. What will be the resultant percentage of recombined genes to normal genes in between which recombination occurred, taking all three types in consideration?",a) 0%,b) 50%,c) 70%,d) 90%,b,Explanation: Taking all types of a double cross over in consideration only 50% of the resultant will show recombination between the genes which are located on two sides of these recombination events. 
Question 417,9. You cross a p+/v+ p+/v+ male drosophila to a p-/v- p-/v- and obtain the F1 hybrid. Now you cross the F1 male with double recessive female. What will be the recombination phenotype in F2?,a) p+/v+ p-/v- only,b) p+/v+ p-/v- and p-/v- p-/v-,c) p+/v+ p-/v- and p-/v- p-/v- also p+/v- p-/v- and p-/v- p-/v-,d) p+/v+ p-/v- and p-/v- p-/v- also p-/v+ p-/v- and p-/v- p-/v-,b,Explanation: In male drosophila recombination is absent thus there canÕt be formation of p+/v- and p-/v+ gametes at all. This can however be formed in case we use female F1 for the test cross.
Question 418,10. In animals cytological study of recombination was done by_______________,a) Barbara McClintok,b) Stern,c) Creigton,d) Mandel,b,Explanation: Barbara McClintok and Creigton observed crossing over in Plants while Stern showed cytological observation of the same in animals. 
Question 419,1. Bar is a gene often used in recombination study. Which of the following is true for the Bar gene?,a) It is normally present in two copies,b) Three copies of bar are called ultra bar,c) Heterozygous bar females have a less severe effect than homozygous bar female,d) Homozygous bar are of common occurrence,b,"Explanation: Bar is present in single copy in normal genes. Recombination results in two bar genes which in homozygous condition can produce a severe reduction in number of eye facets. Recombination can also result in 3 copies of bar gene in a chromosome which reduces the number to 45, known as the ultra bar. "
Question 420,2. Consider that recombination occurs in 2 strand stage of meiosis. If a Drosophila is heterozygous for the bar locus what will be the result of recombination?,a) The recombination will make them homozygous,b) It will produce ultra bar phenotype,c) It will be heterozygous,d) No exchange,c,Explanation: The exchange in two strand stage will lead to the initial strand having 2 copies of Bar becomes normal and the normal chromosome has two copies. But the resultant will still be heterozygous. Only exchange in 4 strand stage will give ultra-bar.
Question 421,4. How many rounds of replication in BrdU will be needed to visualize Harlequin chromosome?,a) Single,b) Two,c) Three,d) Four,b,Explanation: Due to the semiconservative nature of DNA replication in the 1st round the chromosome will have only one parental strand and one strand with BrdU. When two rounds are complete one chromosome had only BrdU strand and other has parental type. The BrdU strand is lighter so distinguishes the appearance.
Question 422,5. If two genes are unlinked the recombination frequency will be?,a) 25%,b) 50%,c) 75%,d) 100%,b,Explanation: When two genes are unlinked they assort independently. So there is an equal chance of production of parental and recombinant phenotype. Thus recombination frequency is 50%.
Question 423,"6. Is two crossovers occur between same two strands, this will result in__________",a) All recombinant strands,b) Three recombinant strands with different loci exchanged,c) Exchange of middle portion between two strands,d) Exchange of ends,c,Explanation: Double cross over event occurring between two strands only result in the production of two strands that exchanged a portion between them in the middle. The other two strands remain unaffected.
Question 424,7. Double cross over involving ________ strands result in 100% recombinant strands.,a) 1,b) 2,c) 3,d) 4,d,"Explanation: Double cross over event between for strands will result in all the strands exchanging their genes. Thus, all the resultant will be recombinant so recombination frequency is 100%."
Question 425,"8. If a recombination event of three points crossing produces 6 DCO, 142 SCO and 352 NCO. What will be the percentage cross over between the terminal genes.",a) 10%,b) 20.8%,c) 14.8%,d) 30.8%,d,Explanation: Recombination frequency between terminal genes will be as {(Single cross over frequency)+2(double cross over frequency)}/100. This will result in 30.8%.
Question 426,9. If single cross over frequency between two genes r and q and q and s in 3 point mapping is 0.6 and 0.2 respectively. What will be the expected double cross over frequency?,a) 0.012,b) 0.010,c) 0.022,d) 0.024,c,Explanation: Expected double cross over frequency by probability rule is product of the two single crossover frequencies in three point mapping. Here 20.8X10.0/10000 results on 0.022.
Question 427,10. In an experiment you calculate the expected DCO frequency to be 0.022 but in reality you observe that only 0.012 recombination frequency. What is the phenomenon resulting in this?,a) Coincidence,b) Interference,c) Penitence,d) Expressivity,b,Explanation: A single cross over in nearby region depreciates that probability of a DCO occurring in nearby regions. This phenomenon is known as interference.
Question 428,11. Which of the following will result in parental phenotype?,a) DCO in between two genes considering four strands,b) Even number of DCO between two genes,c) Odd number of DCO between two genes,d) Single cross over at 4 strand stage between two genes,b,Explanation: Even number of DCO between two genes leads to exchange of small parts between the two genes but the resultant is the same as the parental as the terminal genes remain unchanged.
Question 429,12. What will be the nature of curve with map distances plotted in X axis and percentage recombination in Y axis?,a) Parallel to X axis,b) Increasing in a straight line,c) Parabolic,d) Exponential,d,Explanation: The observed curve is seen to be exponential which reaches a saturation point when the recombination frequency is about 50%.
Question 430,1.  Homologous DNA recombination in prokaryotes take place for________________,a) Increasing variability,b) Repair,c) Incorporation of gene,d) Taking up a plasmid from media,b,"Explanation: In prokaryotes, the repair is mainly the sole recombination as these organisms have only one copy of chromosomes. Two copies are available only during fission when this recombination takes place. Gene transfer processes and their incorporation are very rare."
Question 431,"2. If an organism has 8 chromosomes in diploid condition, what will be the number of chromosomes after telophase of meiosis 1?",a) 2,b) 4,c) 8,d) 16,c,Explanation: In meiosis 1 there is 1st doubling of the chromosomes which are then distributed in two cells at its end.

Which of the following is the correct pathway for developing female characters?,a) Sxl- SR- Tra- Dsx- Male gene repression,b) Sxl- Tra- SR- Dsx- Male gene repression,c) Sxl- Tra- Dsx- SR- Male gene repression,d) Sxl- SR- Dsx- Tra- Male gene repression,b,"Explanation: Functional Sxl proteins, controls the splicing of tra gene and produces functional Tra protein. Tra interacts with SR proteins controlling splicing of Dsx giving female specific DsxF which ultimately represses male specific characters."
Question 666,1.  The XO system of sex determination is found in ______________,a) Insects,b) Birds,c) Reptiles,d) Mammals,a,"Explanation: Insects have this XO system of sex determination. Thus it can be seen in Grasshopper, cockroaches, bees etc. Other options here have different modes of sex determination other than XO."
Question 667,2. In case of XO system if an organism has AA+XO it will be a _______,a) Male,b) Neuter,c) Female,d) Bisexual,a,"Explanation: In XO system presence of one copy of X chromosome produces a male, while there is no Y chromosome. Two copies give a female."
Question 668,3. In XO system a male has a mother but not a _____________,a) Grand father,b) Father,c) Grand mother,d) Sibling,b,"Explanation: The males are produced by parthenogenesis, i.e. by mitosis. While fertilization only takes place in case of a female child, only the two X chromosomes come together. Thus, the male has a mother but no father; they do however have a grandfather."
Question 669,5. In ZZ/ZW system which of the following is true?,a) All organisms have ZZ chromosome,b) The chromosomes are shaped like Z,c) Females have ZW constitution,d) Male is heterozygous,c,"Explanation: ZZ/ZW sex determination system is much like XX/XY system. However, in this case male is homozygous ZZ and female is heterozygous ZW. In this case to avoid confusion different notation is used and not because of the shape."
Question 670,"6. In ZZ/ZW system if there is a recessive Z allele carrying a distinct phenotype, it will have greater probability of expression in ____________",a) Male,b) Female,c) Recessive genes will not be expressed,d) Both genders equally,b,Explanation: Females being heterozygous will lack the compensating functional copy from other Z chromosomes will express it with greater probability. This is similar to the fact that X linked recessive disorder in mammals is expressed more in males.
Question 671,7. Genic system of sex determination is seen in _______________,a) Yeast,b) Fishes,c) Reptiles,d) Mammals,a,Explanation: Yeast and other eukaryotic microorganism have this genic system of sex determination. In this case there is no special sex chromosome.
Question 672,8. In bees the males are produced by _________,a) Mitosis and then fertilization,b) Meiosis and then fertilization,c) Mitosis but no fertilization,d) Meiosis but no fertilizaton,c,Explanation: Bees have XO system of sex determination. In it the males are produced by parthenogenesis i.e. here is mitosis occurring in the mother that gives the zygote for male offspring.
Question 673,10. Which of the following is true for a genic mode of sex determination?,a) It is seen in higher eukaryotes,b) Gene locus determines gender,c) XX will always give female in this case,d) It makes use of parthenogenesis for producing male offspring,b,"Explanation: Genic mode of sex determination is seen in eukaryotic microorganisms. In this case, there is no separate chromosome but allele at the gene locus determines sex."
Question 674,11. In yeast the gene responsible for sex determination is ______________,a) SXL,b) XCE,c) MAT,d) XIST,c,"Explanation: In yeast, the genes at the MAT locus are responsible for determining the sex. Sex is mainly determined as mating factor and it alternates with every generation."
Question 675,12. In yeast a MAT a type yeast can mate with __________,a) MAT alpha,b) MAT beta,c) MAT a,d) It canÕt mate,a,"Explanation: There are two mating types in yeast, MAT a and MAT alpha. Only yeast cells of opposite mating types can mate. In this case MAT, a can thus mate with MAT alpha. There is no MAT beta."
Question 676,1.  Mammals have _______________ type of sex determination.,a) XX/ XY,b) XX/ XO,c) ZZ/ ZY,d) Genic,a,"Explanation: Like Drosophila mammals also have XX/ XY mode of sex determination. However, the mechanism of sex determination in this case is much different."
Question 677,2. In Drosophila an organism with the genetic composition AA+XXY will be a normal female. What will be the case for mammal?,a) Normal female,b) Normal male,c) Klinefelter,d) Turner,c,"Explanation: IN mammals unlike drosophila the presence of Y chromosome determines maleness, thus XXY will have male characters. Again the presence of additional X chromosome will give rise to some female characters resulting in klinefelter."
Question 678,3. In mammals which of the following will be a Turner?,a) AA + XXY,b) AA+ XYY,c) AA + XO/ XY,d) AA+ XO,d,Explanation: AA+ XO will be a turner. This condition the female characters are underdeveloped due to the absence of one X chromosome. AA+ XO/XY on the other hand is intersex.
Question 679,5. The gene for sex determination in mammals is _________ and it is located in ___________,"a) MAT, Y","b) SRY, Y","c) MAT, X","d) SRY, X",b,Explanation: SRY is the gene in Y chromosome that is necessary for the development of male characters. It is located in the Y chromosome. The MAT is sex determining factor for yeast.
Question 680,"6. In an experiment, you add the short arm of Y chromosome to a cell line with composition AA+ XX. What will you see?",a) The cell rejects the Y chromosome,b) The cell develop female character,c) The cell develop male character,d) The cell develop neuter gender character,c,Explanation: The short arm of the Y chromosome is carrying the SRY gene which determines the sex of the organism. Thus introduction of Y chromosome will promote the development of male characters. 
Question 681,7. Which of the following is wrong for sex chromosome?,a) X chromosome is larger than Y,b) Female human are homozygous,c) Y chromosome carries TDF,d) All genes present on Y chromosome are unique to it,d,"Explanation: There is a homologous region between the X and Y chromosome, and genes in Y chromosome in that area is not unique to it. TDF is another name used for SRC gene that is also located on Y chromosome."
Question 682,8. Klinefelter syndrome results due to ____________,a) Non-disjunction in the male gamete,b) Non-disjunction in the female gamete,c) Gradual loss of chromosome,d) Non-disjunction in any of the gametes,d,Explanation: Klinefelter syndrome results from a genetic combination AA+ XXY; this can result from non-disjunction in either male or female gamete.
Question 683,9. A person with a genetic composition AA+XYY composition. The non-disjunction is in the __________ parent and in _____________ meiotic division.,"a) Male, 1st","b) Male, 2nd","c) Female, 1st","d) Female, 2nd",b,Explanation: A female can never have Y chromosome to start with so the non-disjunction is in a male. If the non-disjunction was in 1st division improper segregation of X and Y will produce XY gamete. Here there is an improper 2nd division where 2Y generated in meiosis 2 moves to same pole giving YY gamete.
Question 684,11. The intersex is produced by ________________,a) Fusion of a male and female zygote,b) Loss of X chromosome from some cells,c) Loss of Y chromosomes from some cells,d) Gain of X or Y chromosome due to non-disjunction,c,"Explanation: Intersex has the combination AA+ XO/XY. Presence of Y chromosomes develops male character so AA+XY cells are male. Absence of Y gives female characters so AA+XO gives female, this is due to loss of Y chromosome from these cells. Overall it results in intersex."
Question 685,2.  An X linked recessive gene would appear to __________________,a) Be expressed in both males and females equally,b) Skip generations,c) Be lethal,d) Gradually degrade,b,Explanation: Sex linked genes especially the sex linked recessive gene skips generations before expression. It is expressed more in males than female and is not necessarily lethal.
Question 686,3. A Y linked gene ___________________,a) Is expressed only when homozygous,b) Is present near the telomere of long arm in human,c) Is carried by mother,d) Expressed only in men,d,"Explanation: A Y linked gene is expressed only in men and never in females as females lack a Y chromosome. It is not expressed in homozygous, rather in hemizygous for as its present only in a single copy. The region near that telomere is common for both sex chromosomes, so it is not sex linked."
Question 687,4. Genes which are present in the homologous region of X and Y chromosomes are called______________,a) Autosomal,b) Sex linked,c) Partially sex linked,d) Unlinked,c,Explanation: Genes present in the homologous region of X and Y chromosomes are known as partially sex linked. Although they are present on sex chromosome their inheritance pattern is like normal genes.
Question 688,5. Choose the odd one out.,a) Color blindness,b) Haemophilia,c) Duchenne muscular dystrophy,d) Faulty tooth enamel,d,"Explanation: While the first three diseases are X linked recessive diseases, the last i.e. faulty tooth enamel and decolonization is a dominant trait."
Question 689,"7. In a family of four including a normal mother, a normal father, a color blind son and a normal son; who do you think has the defective X gene other than the affected son?",a) The mother,b) The father,c) The normal son,d) The effected son only,a,"Explanation: Males have only one X chromosome, so if the father or normal son carried the defective X gene they would show the phenotypic effect. Since the female has two copies of X chromosome, only in homozygous form the recessive gene like colorblindness is expressed. So mother here is a carrier."
Question 690,8. A colorblind mother and a normal father give birth to a Klinefelter child with normal vision. Where do you think the non-disjunction has taken place?,a) 1st meiotic division of mother,b) 2nd meiotic division of the father,c) 2nd meiotic division of mother,d) 1st meiotic division of father,d,Explanation: The non disjunction must be in the male parent as the child was not color blind. This is possible only if one X chromosome was normal which here came from father. Also as the disjunction produced XY and not two copies of same chromosome it must have been in 1st division.
Question 691,"9. If colorblindness was a dominant trait, which of the following would not be true?",a) It would be expressed in heterozygous females,b) It would be expressed in males,c) It would never be turned off,d) It would not skip generations,c,"Explanation: Due to dosage compensation X chromosomes are randomly turned off, so the mutant X could as well be turned off in heterozygote. Also it will affect every generation as it would be dominant. Option a and b are also true."
Question 692,10. What is the probability that the son of a color blind father would be color blind?,a) 0,b) 1/4,c) 1/2,d) 1,a,"Explanation: Sons get the Y chromosome from father and the X from mother. So unless the mother is also a carrier, there is no probability of the son being colorblind."
Question 693,11. Y linked inheritance is _______________ inheritance.,a) Criss cross,b) Straight,c) Loop,d) Jumping,b,Explanation: The inheritance pattern of Y linked gene is straight as it moves from father to son. Only males can inherit these traits.
Question 694,12. Which of the following is wrong?,a) Y chromosome lacks dosage compensation,b) X linked genes are inherited as criss cross,c) Y linked gene like haemophilia passes from father to son,d) X linked recessive genes are carried by females,c,"Explanation: It is true that Y linked genes pass from father to son, but Haemophilia is not a Y linked gene. It is a recessive X linked gene."
Question 695,13. Which of the following is a Y linked gene?,a) Faulty dental enamel,b) Haemophilia,c) Hypertrichosis,d) Phenyl ketone urea,c,Explanation: Among the following options only hypertrichosis is a Y linked gene. It is the presence of hair in the ear. It follows the Y linked rule of inheritance.
Question 696,14. Which of the following is partially sex linked?,a) Complete colorblindness,b) Hypertrichosis,c) Faulty tooth enamel,d) Haemophilia,a,Explanation: While red green colorblindness is an X linked recessive trait. Complete colorblindness however is a partially sex linked gene in man.
Question 697,15. A turner child born to normal parents is haemophilic. Where did the non-disjunction occur?,a) Mother,b) Father,c) Zygote,d) Grand mother,b,"Explanation: The only possibility here is that the mother was a carrier. The egg received this defective X chromosome from mother and no sex chromosome from the father. Thus, there was non disjunction in the father. The resultant child was AA+ XÕO. (XÕ=mutant). "
Question 698,1.  Both Drosophila and mammals have XY system of sex determination. Dosage compensation y inactivation of one X chromosome is seen in ___________________,a) Mammals,b) Drosophila,c) Metaphase,d) Telophase,a,Explanation: Only in case of mammals dosage compensation mechanism is by inactivation of one X chromosome. In Drosophila there is a different mechanism.
Question 699,2. Barr bodies are found ________________,a) In the cytoplasm of female,b) In the nuclei of female,c) In the cytoplasm of male,d) In the nuclei of male,b,Explanation: The inactivated X chromosome in female forms a highly condensed structure called the Barr body which is found in the nuclei. As male have only one X chromosome is no inactivation and no Barr body.
Question 700,4. If a chromosome loses its XIC due to deletion it will_______________________,a) Always be activated,b) Never be activated,c) Form Barr body,d) Be degraded,a,"Explanation: XIC is X inactivation centre, only one X with XIC stays active in a cell. Now is a chromosome loses is XIC that will not be counted as X chromosome and will stay active."
Question 701,"5. Due to the translocation process, the XIC from one X chromosome in a woman passed to chromosome 3. The individual died. What were the probable reasons of death?",a) The X chromosome was unable to show its effect,b) Both X chromosome being active too much gene product was produced,c) Inactivation of chromosome 3,d) Hyper activation of autosomes,c,Explanation: As XIC translocated to chromosome 3 now it can be counted as an X chromosome. In some cells randomly this chromosome 3 is condensed and inactivated which prevents the important autosomal gene product from being formed. Thus the individual dies.
Question 702,6. Lysonization takes place ____________,a) 7th day after fertilization,b) 15th day after fertilization,c) 1st month after fertilization,d) 6th month after fertilization,b,Explanation: Lysonization process takes place in the 15th day after fertilization when the embryo is 500-1000 cell stage. This inactivated one X chromosome in each cell.
Question 703,7. _____________________ determines which X chromosome remains active.,a) XIST,b) XCE,c) XIC,d) RB,b,Explanation: XCE or X controlling element that is present in the XIC region determines which X chromosome will be inactivated.
Question 704,8. Which one of the following is the only active gene in the inactivated X chromosome?,a) XIST,b) XCE,c) Histone coding gene,d) Ribosomal gene,a,"Explanation: The X inactive specific transcript (XIST in humans/ Xist in mice) gene, is located in the XIC, itÕs expressed exclusively from the inactive X chromosome, producing a 17 kb non-coding RNA that is not translated. Ribosome genes are in nucleolus."
Question 705,10. XIST mRNA coats the inactive X and calls in _____________,a) tRNA and ribosome,b) Other mRNA,c) Deacetylase and specific methylase,d) Acetylase and demethylase,c,Explanation: Histone deacetylases lead to the removal of acetyl group from specific histone residues. This leads to exposure of positive charges on then and causes stronger binding. Specific methylase also plays similar role. Together they help in heterochromatin formation.
Question 706,11. Tortoise shell or calico cats are always ________________ for O locus that is responsible for orange color development.,a) Homozygous,b) Heterozygous,c) Deleterious,d) Duplication,b,Explanation: The O gene is responsible for orange color development. Only dominant O can express it over the mutant B gene that causes black color. O gene is located in X chromosome. Thus in heterozygous condition if O carrying X chromosome is inactivated it leads to black patch as seen here.
Question 707,12. Calico cats are always______________,a) Male,b) Female,c) Klinefelter,d) Turner,b,"Explanation: In calico cats there is development of black and orange and white patches. This is possible only when the dominant O allele is turned off in some X chromosome due to dosage compensation. As males have only one X chromosome they are never turned off. Thus, only females show this trait."
Question 708,13. The XXY klinefelter survive but trisomy in most autosome is lethal. Why?,a) Autosome carries more genes,b) Autosomes have better dominant recessive relations,c) X chromosomes are inactivated,d) Autosomes are more in number,c,Explanation: Due to dosage compensation only one X chromosome in XXY says active. So the effect of excess X chromosome is somewhat mitigated. In autosome there is no such inactivation and excess of gene products leads to lethality.
Question 709,14. Which one of the following is true for Drosophila?,a) They donÕt have X chromosome,b) One of the female X chromosome is inactivated,c) The male Y chromosome is inactivated,d) The male X chromosome is hyper active,d,"Explanation: In Drosophila, dosage compensation is achieved in a different way. The maleÕs X chromosome appears to be hyperactivated, allowing it to be transcribed at twice the rate of either X chromosome in the female."
Question 710,1.  The sex influenced traits are present in _______________________,a) Autosome,b) Sex chromosome,c) Mitochondrial chromosome,d) These are epigenetic traits,a,Explanation: Sex influenced traits are present in the autosomes. They are not present in the sex chromosome; although their expression is dependent on the sex of the individual.
Question 711,"3. If A is a sex influenced trait that is more expressed in males, then which of the following is false?",a) Only male having a homozygous recessive form of this gene will not express it,b) No female will express the gene,c) The gene is autosomal,d) Heterozygous female will not express this gene,b,"Explanation: If the sex influenced trait is more expressed in men then it acts as a dominant trait in men. And at the same time, it acts as a recessive trait in female. The female with homozygous form of this trait will thus express it, and men lacking any copy of it in case of recessive homozygote will not express it."
Question 712,"4. If present of horn in a breed of sheep is due to the presence of h+ allele which is sex influenced and more expressed in male, choose the off one out.",a) Female with h+ h+,b) Male with h+ h+,c) Female with h h+,d) Male with h h+,c,Explanation: This sex influenced trait is dominant for male and recessive for female. Out of the given options only heterozygous female will not express this trait making it the off one. 
Question 713,"5. Patterned baldness is a sex influenced trait more expressed in a male. If b+ is normal allele making non-bald phenotype and b is mutant leading to bald phenotype, for a cross between a bald mother and normal father, what is the probability of a bald son?",a) 0,b) 1/4,c) 1/2,d) 1,d,"Explanation: Baldness is a sex influenced trait, so the mother is certainly b/b and the father is b+,b+. So, the son will get at least one baldness allele from the mother. Heterozygous male expresses the sex influenced trait; hence the son will definitely be bald."
Question 714,7. Choose the odd one out on the basis of sex influence.,a) Cleft palate,b) Club foot,c) Gout,d) Osteoporosis,d,"Explanation: All the mentioned options are sex influenced traits. Cleft palate, Club foot and Gout are dominant for males while osteoporosis is dominant for females."
Question 715,8. What will be the phenotype and genotype of a daughter born to bald mother and non-bald father?,a) b+/b+ non-bald,b) b+/b+ bald,c) b/b+ non-bald,d) b/b+ bald,c,Explanation: Baldness is a dominant gene for a male. A bald mother is thus homozygous for the allele; at least one baldness gene will thus pass to offspring from her. The father is normal so he must lack any baldness allele and a normal gene will pass from him. Hence daughter is a heterozygote and normal.
Question 716,9. Which one of the following will not be expressed in female even in homozygous form?,a) Cock feathering,b) Cleft palate,c) Osteoporosis,d) Color blindness,a,"Explanation: Cock feathering is a sex limited trait which is expressed only on one sex depending. Even if the other sex is homozygous for it, the phenotype will not be expressed unless there is serious hormonal change."
Question 717,"10. If a bull doesnÕt express the milking factor, where m+ is normal and m is a mutant gene, its genotype is?",a) m+/m+,b) m+/m,c) m/m,d) CanÕt be specified,d,"Explanation: Milking factor is a sex influenced trait that is only expressed in females i.e. cows. Bulls will never express these genes irrespective of their phenotype. Hence, their genotype canÕt be specified."
Question 718,11. Appearance of cock feather in chicken is ________________,a) X linked,b) Y linked,c) Sex influenced,d) Sex limited,d,"Explanation: This gene is located in the autosome so itÕs not X or Y linked. Cock feathering will not be seen in hen even when it is homozygous, hence itÕs not sex influenced. Thus, it is sex limited trait."
Question 719,12. Sex influenced genes will not occur in ________________,a) Homologous autosome,b) Homologous part of sex chromosome,c) Short arm of human Y chromosome,d) On autosomes of male,c,"Explanation: Short arm of human Y chromosome is not homologous to X chromosome. Thus, genes there will show Y linkage. Sex influenced genes donÕt show linkage and are not exclusive to X or Y chromosomes, so it will not be present there."
Question 720,1.  In incomplete dominance__________________,a) Phenotype of both allele is expressed,b) Phenotype of only one allele is expressed,c) Phenotype of neither of the alleles are expressed,d) Phenotype of both allele is partially expressed,d,Explanation: In case of incomplete dominance the expression of the phenotype of neither of the allele is complete; although one is more expressed than another.
Question 721,3. Choose the wrong one out.,a) Codominant genes are never haplosufficient,b) Dominant phenotype is expressed when a gene is haplosufficient,c) Incomplele dominance is the presence of haplosufficiency,d) In homozygous condition an allele can express its phenotype be it the dominant or recessive allele in nature,c,Explanation: Haplosufficiency is the condition when an allele can express itself fully and produce its phenotype completely even in heterozygous condition. Incomplete dominance results from lack of haplosufficiency.
Question 722,4. A white and a black chicken give an egg. What is the probability of the progeny born being Andalusian?,a) 1/6,b) 1/4,c) 1/2,d) 1,d,Explanation: As the progeny will receive one plumage color allele from each of its parents its resultant genotype will be heterozygote. Heterozygous chickens are Andalusian so the probability is 1 or it is certain.
Question 723,5. In case of incomplete dominance monohybrid F1 ________________ is 1:2:1.,a) Genotype,b) Phenotype,c) Bothe genotype and phenotype,d) The ratio is wrong,c,Explanation: In case of incomplete dominance the phenotype and genotypes are same and the ratio is 1:2:1. This is because the heterozygote has a distinctly different appearance than the homozygote.
Question 724,6. A pink snapdragon is crossed to a white snapdragon. What is the probability of getting a red snap dragon?,a) 1,b) 1/2,c) 1/4,d) None,d,"Explanation: The color of snapdragon flower is controlled by incompletely dominant gene which in heterozygous condition expressed pink color. As the cross will only yield heterozygous and homozygous white allele condition, it is impossible to get a red flower which needs homozygous red condition."
Question 725,7. Choose the odd one out.,a) MN blood group,b) ABO blood group,c) Color of chicken feather,d) Coat color of short horn cattle,c,Explanation: This is because color of chicken feathering is an incompletely dominant trait while the remaining characters are codominant traits.
Question 726,8. A child is born to a mother whose blood group is A and a father whose blood group is B. The child is of blood group A. According to this which of the following is true?,a) The mother has Bombay blood group,b) The childÕs father is some other man,c) This is a normal case,d) The child has genotype IA/ IA,c,Explanation: In such a case it is possible that the father was a heterozygote. So the case the recessive i allele to the child and the mother gave a dominant A allele. Thus the child has a blood genotype IA/ i and a phenotype of type A.
Question 727,9.  An M blood type daughter is born to a mother who has type M blood group and a father who has type N. Which of the following is true?,a) The father of the child is someone else,b) The mother of the child is someone else,c) This is a normal case,d) The child has genotype M/N,a,"Explanation: MN blood group shows codominance between two alleles M and N. Thus, the daughter to MM mother and NN father should have been MN. But as the daughter is MN, the father of the child is some other man."
Question 728,"10. If you cross two roan cows, what percentage of the progeny would you expect to be roan?",a) 10%,b) 25%,c) 50%,d) 75%,c,"Explanation: Roan coat colour in short horn cattle is a codominant trait n which case the roan cows are heterozygous for the coat colour gene. Thus according to monohybrid ratio _ the progeny of the cross will be heterozygote, hence, roan."
Question 729,11. What are the odds in favor that cross between a black and an Andalusian fowl will give 4 Andalusian fowls?,a) 1/2,b) 1/4,c) 1/8,d) 1/16,d,Explanation: There is _ probability that the progeny generated will be Andalusian. And the odds in favor that such event will occur 4 time is (1/2)4 =1/16.
Question 730,13. Among the progenies born from the mating of a white and an Andalusian fowl there are 5 white chickens. What is the expected total number of progeny?,a) 5,b) 10,c) 15,d) 25,b,Explanation: In the following case half of the progeny so born must have been White while there is _ probabilities that the rest were Andalusian. So overall the number of progeny is expected to be 10.
Question 731,14. In case of codominance product is ___________________,a) Produced from both the alleles,b) Produced from one allele,c) Incompletely produced from both alleles,d) None are functional,a,Explanation: In the case of codominance the product is produced from both the alleles and it is expressed in its fullness. No allele is dominant over the other. 
Question 732,15. If a person has M blood group which of the following is wrong?,a) He is a homozygote,b) His blood reacts to anti M antibody,c) His childÕs blood would react to anti M antibody,d) His child will always have M blood type,d,"Explanation: In this case, the child will have either M blood type or MN depending on the other parent. But the rest of the options are true."
Question 733,1.  If there are multiple alleles for a gene which of the following is true?,a) All the alleles same expressed at the same time,b) Among the multiple copies resent only the most dominant one is expressed,c) Only two alleles are present at a time,d) Only one allele is dominant rest all are recessive,c,Explanation: If a gene has multiple allele then there are varied dominance recessive relations but ultimately one organism has only 2 of these multiple alleles and the relation among them determines the phenotype.
Question 734,"3. If there are 4 alleles for a gene, then what would be the number of genotypes?",a) 5,b) 10,c) 15,d) 20,b,"Explanation: The number of genotypic expression in multiple allele series is given by the formula 0.5[n(n+1)], where n is the number of alleles. So here it would be 10."
Question 735,4. ABO blood group is not an example of ______________,a) Co dominance,b) Multiple allele,c) Epistasis,d) Mendalian relations,c,"Explanation: In ABO blood group there are three alleles IA    IB    IO.  Where he 1st two are codominant and the 3rd is recessive to  the rest. However, they donÕt show epistasis."
Question 736,6. In drosophila eye color is determined by multiple allele systems. Which of the following sequence is true for the dominance relationship?,a) Eosin > red > white,b) Red > eosin > White,c) White > red > eosin,d) Eosin > white > red,b,"Explanation: In case of dominant recessive relations among eye colour in Drosophila, Red is the wild type which is dominant over eosin and white. Eosin on the other hand is also dominant over white."
Question 737,7. If a person had Hh in the H antigen locus and IA i in the blood group locus what would be the blood group?,a) A,b) B,c) AB,d) O,a,"Explanation: In heterozygous condition, the H antigen is effectively produced by the gene which results in the expression of the blood group of the blood group locus. Here the blood group expressed is O."
Question 738,"8. If a mother has blood group O and father has blood group A, the child being type AB, which of the following is wrong?",a) The mother may have IB allele that is passed to daughter,b) The father of the child is someone else with AB blood type,c) The child has IA allele and also IB allele,d) This is an abnormal case,b,Explanation: Even if the father was someone with AB blood type is not possible for one parent to give both the alleles to their child. This is more likely a case of Bombay blood group where the mother is homozygous for the h antigen and her blood group is not expressed.
Question 739,9. IA allele codes for the _________________ while IB codes for _________________,"a) Alpha N galactosamine transferase, galactose transferase","b) Glycosamino glycan transferase, Alpha N glucosamine transferase","c) Alpha glucosamine transferase, Alpha galactosamine transferase","d) Galactose transferase, galactose transferase",a,Explanation: The IA allele produces a glycosyltransferase enzyme that adds the sugar _ N-acetyl galacto-samine to the polysaccharide to produce the A antigen. The IB allele produces a different glycolsyl transferase enzyme that adds the sugar galactose to produce the B antigen.
Question 740,10. The eye color of drosophila is _______________,a) Autosomal,b) Codominant,c) X linked,d) Y linked,c,"Explanation: The eye color gene of drosophila is located in the X chromosome, so it is X linked and shows the respective mode of inheritance."
Question 741,11. Which of the following is true wrong about ABO blood group?,a) It determines the antigen on RBC,b) Some people may secretes a soluble form of this,c) Secretors have se/se gene combination for secretion locus,d) Non- secretors donÕt produce this soluble form,c,"Explanation: Secretors is a dominant phenotype hence Se/Se and Se/se are both secretors, while the genotype in option c se/se is for non-secretors. The rest of the options are true."
Question 742,"12. If a wild type eyed female drosophila is crossed to a white eyed male, what will be the percentage of their progeny with white eyes.",a) 1,b) None,c) Half,d) 1/4,b,"Explanation: Eye colour is present on the X chromosome , so the females of F1 will be heterozygous red eyed(wild-type), and the males will have only one eye colour allele from mother which would be for red eyes."
Question 743,"13. If you cross a red eyed male with a white eyed female, all the sons would be ___________ and all the daughters would be ______________","a) Red eyed, red eyed","b) Red eyed, white eyed","c) White eyed, White eyed","d) White eyed, red eyed",d,Explanation: he F1 daughters would be heterozygous as they get the red allele from mother and white from father- producing red eyes. The sons would have only eye colour allele from mother that would give white eye colour.
Question 744,"14. If you cross a eosin male Drosophila with a red eyed female, the daughters would have________________",a) Eosin eye,b) Red eye,c) White eye,d) No eye colour,b,Explanation: Eosin eye colour is recessive to red eye colour. The daughters which are heterozygote would have one copy of each allele and thus will have red eye colour.
Question 745,"15. If a Drosophila is having XXY sex chromosomal combination with one X bearing white allele for eye colour and another X having eosin allele for eye colour, what would be its phenotype?",a) This is a lethal combination,b) White eyes,c) Red eyes,d) Eosin eyes,d,"Explanation: Eosin eye colour is dominant over white eyes.

If you cross two walnuts, which of the following is impossible?",a) Progeny to be a walnut,b) Progeny to be a single,c) Progeny to be a homozygous Rose,"d) Progeny to have a phenotype other than rose, single, pea or walnut",d,Explanation: The gene interactions in case of chicken comb can only produce these four phenotypes in the ratio 9:3:3:1.
Question 750,"6. If a true breeding rose combed chicken is crossed to walnut combed chicken, what are the only possibilities of the F1 progeny?",a) Walnut,b) Rose,c) Walnut or rose,d) Walnut or rose or pea,c,"Explanation: Considering the most variable of the condition when the walnut is heterozygous in both the loci it can result in walnut or rose in the ratio of 3:1. In other cases, it can mostly result in walnut while parent heterozygous in P locus could also give a rose."
Question 751,"7. In summer squash if you cross different varieties of true breeding sphere shaped squash, you get a disk shaped progeny. What phenomenon is seen here?",a) Gene interaction,b) Epistasis,c) Multiple allele,d) Codominance,a,"Explanation: As the cross lead to the production of a novel phenotype, it is not the case of epistasis but rather a case of gene interaction."
Question 752,8. Which one of the following summer squash would be true breeding?,a) Sphere,b) Disc,c) Long,d) Short,c,Explanation: The long phenotype is produced because of the recessive genes in both the locus. Thus it will be true breeding.

What will be the ratio obtained?,a) 1:2:1,b) 3:1,c) 9:3:3:1,d) 9:6:1,d,Explanation: Here you expect to see a deviation from the normal dihybrid ratio as two genotypes yield the same phenotype. Thus the A/- bb and aa B/- give spheres in 6/16th of the progeny.
Question 755,12. The cross between a true breeding sphere shaped and a long shaped squash gives 30 sphere squash in F2. What is the total number of expected progeny?,a) 30,b) 40,c) 50,d) 60,b,"Explanation: In F the sphere and the long progenies should be produced in a 3:1 ratio. Thus sphere being 30, there must be 10 long. Thus the expected total number is 30+10= 40."
Question 756,"1.  In case of two gene interaction, the gene which is masking the expression of another is called_____________ and the gene whose expression is masked is called_______________","a) Dominant, recessive","b) Recessive, dominant","c) Epistatic, hypostatic","d) Hypostatic, Epistatic",c,Explanation: In case of single gene two alleles which suppress one another we use dominant/ recessive relations. But in case of interaction between two genes we use epistatic for the one that suppresses the expression of another and hypostatic for the one whose expression is suppressed.
Question 757,2. Epistasis is the interaction between_____________ genes.,a) 2,b) 4,c) 8,d) 16,a,Explanation: Epistasis is the interaction between two genes where the genotype of one location affects the expression of genotype at the other location.
Question 758,4. What is the dihybrid phenotypic ratio for recessive epistasis in an F22 generation?,a) 9:3:3:1,b) 9:6:1,c) 9:3:4:1,d) 9:3:4,d,Explanation: In case of recessive epistasis the expression of A/- b/b and a/a b/b  are the same where B is the epistatic locus and A is the hypostatic locus. So the dihybrid ratio is modified to 9:3:4.
Question 759,"5. In mouse agouti locus is hypostatic to pigment development locus. If C is for pigment development, and A is for agouti, and recessive alleles in agouti locus gives black colour and recessive in pigment locus gives white colour, what will be the phenotype of A/- c/c and a/a c/c.","a) Agouti, white","b) Black, agouti","c) Black, black","d) White, white",d,"Explanation: In this case the C gene is epistatic, so unless colour is developed due to C/- there will be no expression of A locus. In both of these cases, C locus has c/c/ alleles, so both the mice are white."
Question 760,6. The cross between a white mouse and a black mouse _______________,a) CanÕt give a Black mouse,b) CanÕt give a White mouse,c) CanÕt give a Agouti mouse,d) Can give all combinations,d,"Explanation: Agouti gene is hypostatic to the color locus, in black mouse the combination is a/a C/- and in albino or white itÕs -/- c/c. So if there is any dominant agouti gene in white mouse it can be expressed in the F1 where C locus would be C/-, so all combinations are possible."
Question 761,7. Which one of the following has dominant allele in both gene locus?,a) Black,b) Albino,c) Agouti,d) White,c,"Explanation: To give an agouti mouse the gene combination should be A/- C/-, so it must have atleast one dominant gene in both the gene locus."
Question 762,"8. Coat colour in Labrador retriever is controlled by epistasis. B specifies black pigment, b is for brown pigment (recessive) and E locus determines the expression of B locus. Which one of the following is wrong?",a) bb EE gives yellow,b) Bb EE gives black,c) bb Ee gives brown,d) BB EE gives black,a,"Explanation: According to the rules of recessive epistasis, at least one dominant allele at the E locus is needed for expression at the b locus. As in option bb EE gives yellow the E locus is dominant so b locus is expressed to give chocolate or brown colour not yellow."
Question 763,"10. In case of dominant epistasis which of the following will have the same expression, when A is the epistatic locus?",a) A/a B/b and a/a B/b,b) A/A b/b and A/A B/b,c) a/a b/b and A/a b/b,d) a/a b/b and a/a B/B,b,"Explanation: According to the description of dominant epistasis given, A is the epistatic locus, thus presence of even one set of dominant gene at A locus will give the same effect irrespective of the B locus. "
Question 764,11. Dominant epistasis ratio with A as epistatic gene 12:3:1 corresponds to ________________,a) A/- B/- : A/- b/b : a/a B/-,b) a/a B/- : a/a b/b : a/a b/-,c) A/A B/-: A/- B/-: a/a b/b,d) A/- -/- : a/a B/-: a/a b/b,d,"Explanation: In case of dominant epistasis, if there is atleast one dominant allele here A in the epistatic locus, the gene combination at B locus will not affect the phenotype. So the combination at B can be written as -/-."
Question 765,12. Which one of the following is not the case of epistasis?,a) Fur colour in mouse,b) Fruit colour in summer squash,c) Fruit shape in summer squash,d) Coat colour in labrador,c,"Explanation: White Fur colour in mouse and coat colour in Labrador is the case of recessive epistasis, and Fruit color in summer squash being a case of dominant epistasis, fruit shape of summer squash is gene interaction and not epistasis."
Question 766,13. Which of the following is incorrect about the graying of coat colour of horse?,a) The graying is a case of dominant epistasis,b) The colour of the fur and skin gradually turns grey,c) The G/G or G/g shows greying,d) Coat colour of horse with G/- combination will grey irrespective of what was its colour to start with,b,Explanation: The Greying is seen only in the fur colour of the mature horse and not in the coloring of the skin. The rest of the options are correct and fit for the case f dominant epistasis.
Question 767,"14. In case of summer squash, the W locus shows dominant epistasis over the Y locus. W locus develop white colour while /- give yellow and y/y gives green. If you cross a yellow and a green summer squash you canÕt get______________",a) Yellow,b) Green,c) White,d) You can get all,c,"Explanation: In both the parents in this case the W locus must have homozygous recessive gene. Thus, the cross can never give a heterozygous case in W locus which is needed for development of white colour."
Question 768,15. In case of summer squash which of the following is not right.,a) The W allele produces a White substance,b) A white substance is converted to Yellow when dominant Y allele is present,c) The transformation of white substance to yellow is via green intermediate,d) The green intermediate has combination at the Y locus y/y,a,Explanation: In this case there is a white substance initially produced which is converted to yellow via green intermediate. Y allele promotes the green to yellow conversion. White the W allele blocks the white to green conversion so further pathway is also blocked giving white summer squash.

Flower colour in sweet pea shows duplicate epistasis, if purple colour is dominant what is the F2 ratio?",a) 15:1,b) 9:7,c) 3:1,d) 9:3:4,b,Explanation: The F2 ratio in recessive duplicate epistasis as seen in case of sweet pea flower colour is 9:7. Where the ratio corresponds to purple(9): white(7) respectively.
Question 770,2. Which of the following condition in recessive duplicate epistasis will give the odd phenotype?,a) A/- B/-,b) A/- b/b,c) a/a B/-,d) a/a b/b,a,Explanation: Only when atleast one dominant allele is present in both the locus we get the expression of dominant phenotype. Otherwise the resulting cases give only recessive phenotype.
Question 771,4. Choose the off one out in case of duplicate recessive episasis.,a) A/A b/b,b) A/A B/B,c) A/a B/b,d) A/a B/-,a,"Explanation: All other remaining locus will express the dominant phenotype as they have atleast one dominant allele in each locus, but the A/A b/b is recessive for B locus and will express recessive character."
Question 772,"5. If you self cross purple flower in sweet pea, you will get__________",a) Purple flower in every occasion,b) White flower in every occasion,c) May be white or purple flower,d) A blend of white and purple flower,c,"Explanation: If the purple flower is homozygous in both loci then we will get only purple flowers, but heterozygosity in both loci would give a 9:7 ratio of purple to white flower in the F1."
Question 773,6. Self crossing a white flower of sweet pea would give a ____________________,a) White flower only,b) Equal probability of white or purple,c) More white flower than purple,d) Purple flowers only,a,"Explanation: The white flower arises due to a homozygous recessive condition in atleast one of the two gene locus. In this case self crossing can never yield a combination of heterozygous or homozygous dominant at that gene locus, so it will only give white flowers."
Question 774,7. In sweet pea a white substance is first converted to a ___________ substance by 1st gene and that to a ______________ substance by 2nd gene to give a purple flower.,"a) Yellow, purple","b) Green, purple","c) Purple, yellow","d) White, yellow",d,Explanation: It is expected that in case of duplicate recessive epistasis of sweet pea plant a white substance is 1st converted to another white substance that is converted to purple substance in case of presence of two dominant genes. If any of these genes are absent this would give white flower.
Question 775,8. What is the phenotypic ratio in case of duplicate dominant epistasis?,a) 9:3:4,b) 12:3:4,c) 15:1,d) 9:7,c,Explanation: In case of duplicate dominant epistasis the normal 9:3:3:1 ratio is modified to give the ratio of 15:1. In this case the 1/16 represents homozygous recessive condition.
Question 776,"9. ShepherdÕs purse has two shape heart and narrow. If you cross a true breeding heart to a true breeding narrow, F1 will give___________",a) Heart,b) Narrow,c) A mixture of heart or narrow,d) Disc shaped,a,Explanation: A heart shaped ShepherdÕs purse is dominant over the narrow shaped one. Thus crossing the true breeding form of each will give a heterozygous condition in both the locus resulting in heart phenotype. Disc is a phenotype for summer squash gene interaction.
Question 777,10. The 15/16 of the duplicate dominant epistasis doesnÕt correspond to _____________,a) A/a B/b,b) A/A b/b,c) a/a B/b,d) a/a b/b,d,Explanation: A recessive phenotype in both the locus will result in the recessive gene expression forming 1/15 of the duplicate epistasis ratio. 
Question 778,"11. You crossed two heart shaped ShepherdÕs purse which is heterozygous at one locus and homozygous recessive at other gene locus, what would be the ratio of heart shaped and narrow in F1?",a) All heart,b) All narrow,c) 3:1,d) 15:1,a,"Explanation: As the parent is homozygous recessive at one locus and heterozygous at the other, the combinations that are yield would give 3:1 ratio of heart to narrow."
Question 779,"2. In Aurea, a type of snapdragon, only ______________ carrying dominant genes live.",a) Homozygous,b) Homozygote,c) Heterozygote,d) Heterozygous,c,Explanation: In this case the heterozygote produces 2:1 ratio of yellow: green leaves. The homozygous dominant individual germinates but due to lack of chlorophyll fails to grow.
Question 780,3. The ______________ mouse is lethal.,a) Homozygous white,b) Homozygous black,c) Heterozygous agouti,d) Homozygous yellow,d,Explanation: The homozygous yellow mouse dies off as it carries the lethal gene in two copies. However in all other options the mouse likes.
Question 781,4. Cross of two yellow mice will give _____________ normal mouse.,a) 1/4,b) 2/4,c) 1/3,d) 2/3,c,Explanation: Homozygous condition of the yellow allele will lead to lethality thus the living yellow mouse are heterozygous. Their cross will give 1/4th of homozygous yellow allele mice which will die changing the proportion of normal mice to 1.3rd of the living ones.
Question 782,5. Which of the following is not true for yellow mice?,a) The homozygous yellow mice die,b) A normal ice crossed to yellow mice will always give normal probabilities of F1,c) In yellow mice the yellow coloring allele is under control of Raly promoter,d) The homozygous mouse dies as the yellow allele is produced in excess,d,"Explanation: In homozygous condition the mice die not due to over expression of agouti, or yellow coloring gene but due to absence of expression of Raly gene."
Question 783,6. The lethal mutation that is seen in the yellow mice is due to _______________ mutation,a) Insertion,b) Deletion,c) Non-sense,d) Frame shift,b,Explanation: The mutation seen in this case is deletion mutation.

A person homozygous for lethal allele______________,a) Always dies,b) Always expresses the phenotype,c) May not express the phenotype,d) They have severe abnormalities,c,"Explanation: A person with a lethal allele doesnÕt always die, as in case of temperature sensitive mutant it is seen that the lethality only occurs at higher temperature."
Question 786,9. HuntingtonÕs disease affects individuals carrying the gene starting from the age of ____________,a) 10,b) 20,c) 30,d) Random,c,"Explanation: People carrying this dominant allele show the symptoms starting from their 30s. Thus, even with the presence of dominant allele, it is not expressed right from the start."
Question 787,1.  An individual with a homozygous genotype for a particular phenotype ____________ expresses the phenotype.,a) Always,b) Never,c) Sometimes,d) Unknown relation,c,Explanation: It is not that the homozygous genotype will always express the required phenotype. It may or may not express it depending on some factors. This gives the concept of penetrance.

The formation of cones with brown, yellow colour expresses the _______________ and white expresses the _______________","a) Penetrance, expressivity","b) Expressivity, genotype","c) Genotype, Phenotype","d) Expressivity, penetrance",d,"Explanation: The formation of coloured cones is sure that the cones are penetrant, it is variation in the expressivity that gives them different colour. The uncoloured cone shows no penetrance."
Question 789,3. Choose the incorrect option about penetrance.,a) If penetrance is 100% all recessive genotype shows one phenotype,b) If penetrance is 100% the expressivity is 100%,c) If penetrance is 100% all the heterozygotes have similar phenotype,d) If penetrance is 100% all the dominant genotypes have a different phenotype from recessive,b,Explanation: In case of penetrance being 100% it makes sure that a particular phenotype that is determined by the genotype is expressed in all individuals. But the limit to which it is expressed in the different individuals can vary so the expressivity may not always be 100%.

If the gene is non-penetrant then which of the following is not right?,a) The pedigree chart will not express the defecting phenotype in that individual,b) The personÕs children are not likely to express that phenotype,c) The expressivity is 0%,d) The genotype here didnÕt make its proper phenotypic expression,b,"Explanation: If the gene is non-penetrant for an individual it is not mandatory that it will also be non-penetrant for his offspring. As a result, the pedigree could appear to skip a generation with the parent being a carrier."
Question 791,6. Which of the following trait shows only variation in expressivity?,a) Brachydactyly,b) Osteoporosis imperfectica,c) Pea seed colour,d) Polydactyly,b,Explanation: In case of pea seed colour the penetrance and expressivity are both 100%. In case of brachydactyly and polydactyly the penetrance varies as well as the expressivity. But in the case on osteoporosis imperfectica it is almost 100% penetrant but the expressivity is different.

Differential expression of the genetic material depending on its parentage of inheritance gives____________,a) Penetrance,b) Expressivity,c) Imprinting,d) Non-penetrance,c,Explanation: Genomic imprinting states that the alleles of some genes vary in their or expression depending on the fact that they are inherited from the mother or the father.
Question 797,"3. In Igf2 of human ______________ allele is expressed, and Igfr of mice __________ allele is expressed.","a) Maternal, maternal","b) Paternal, paternal","c) Maternal, paternal","d) Paternal, maternal",d,"Explanation: The insulin like growth factor Igf for human shows that there only the paternal allele is expressed, but in its receptor, in case of mice the maternal allele is expressed. Thus both the alles must be present for proper function of the signal."
Question 798,4. Which of the following doesnÕt agree with XIST?,a) It codes for an mRNA that coats the inactive X chromosome into a bar body,b) It is the only gene that is active in inactive X chromosome,c) The embryo cells shows that maternal allele XIST is active over paternal,d) Inactivation is seen in somatic cells,c,Explanation: XIST allele in case of the embryo doesnÕt show any imprinting. Imprinting is seen in case of the extra-embryonic cells. 
Question 799,6. Choose the wrong statement in the regulation of imprinting.,a) Methylation of the C residues are seen in the CpG islands,b) The methylation prevents binding of the RNA polymerase,c) Genes are methylated at random,d) Deletion of gene with methylated CpG islands will have no effect,c,Explanation: In the case of imprinting which of the alleleÕs CpG island is methylated depends on the parent from which it is inherited. This shows that the methylation is not random but related to imprinting.
Question 800,"7. In mice if you delete the Igf2 gene from a female, the progeny will_____________",a) Be smaller,b) Die,c) No major change,d) Be larger,c,"Explanation: In mice the Igf2 genes from the female parent is methylated and inactivated by imprinting and only the male one is expressed. Thus, absence of the respective gene in mother shows no significant effect. However, if it were male hen the progeny would be smaller."
Question 801,8. In mice H19 and Igf2 genes are controlled by the same enhancer. Which of the following is true?,a) The enhancer enhances both the gene on promoter binding,b) In one chromosome both the genes are expressed and in other they are not,"c) Igf2 shows paternal imprinting, H19 shows maternal imprinting",d) Both the genes show paternal imprinting,c,Explanation: It is much of a surprise although both the genes can be enhanced by the same enhancer element located downstream of H19 both are not enhanced at once. In maternal gene the H19 is expressed and in paternal gene the Igf2 is expressed.
Question 802,10. Choose the wrong statement from the following.,a) Maternal Igf2 is methylated to prevent expression,b) Paternal H19 is methylated to avoid expression,c) The enhancer can lead to expression of H19 in maternal gene,d) The enhancer canÕt lead to expression of Igf2 in paternal gene,a,Explanation: It is true that the maternal Igf2 is not expressed in mice but the mechanism is via blockage of the enhancer by an insulator called CTCB binding to the CCCTC sequence in between the two adjacent genes. Rest of the options is correct. 
Question 803,11. During _________________ both the H19 alleles are ___________________,"a) Oogenesis, inactivated","b) Oogenesis, activated","c) Oogenesis, hyper-activated","d) Spermatogenesis, activated",b,Explanation: The genomic imprinting has to be reset in every generation. This is achieved via the means that the genes that are maternally inherited are activated during oogenesis and paternally inherited genes are inactivated during the same and reverse for spermatogenesis. H19 is maternally inherited.
Question 804,12. What will happen if an individual receives two copies of a gene from the same parent?,a) UPD,b) One gene will be automatically inactivated,c) Both the genes will show their product,d) Nothing much will be seen,a,"Explanation: This condition gives rise to UPD or uni parental disomy. Here as the imprinting relation will be hampered, the individual may lack any active copy of the gene leading to developmental defects."
Question 805,13. Which of the following is incorrect for Pader will syndrome?,a) This is due to failure of inheritance of several non-imprint genes,b) It is seen for chromosome 15,c) It causes loss of active genes in 15q11-q13,d) It occurs when the region containing specific genes in the maternal chromosome are missing,d,Explanation: In case of Pader Willi syndrome the genes 15q11-q13 contained in the paternal chromosome are missing which leads to the defects. It is not due to the maternal factors missing.
Question 806,14. When the specific non-imprint gene from the chromosome 15 of the mother s missing it leads to _________________,a) Pader Willi syndrome,b) Angelman syndrome,c) DownÕs syndrome,d) Klinefelter syndrome,b,Explanation: In Angelman syndrome the gene in the maternal chromosome 15 region 15q11-q13 is missing which leads to the absence of any functional copy of the gene at all as paternal copy is methylated and inactivated. 
Question 807,15. In Angelman syndrome we donÕt see___________,a) Microcephaly,b) Speech impairment,c) Overeating urge,d) Unprovoked laughter,c,Explanation: The urge to overeat is a symptom of the Pader Willi syndrome and it is not seen in case of Angelman syndrome. While the remaining options are seen in Angelman syndrome due to lack of a functional copy of maternally imprinted gene.
Question 808,1. If you run the whole RNA extract on a gel you will get ____________ bands normally.,a) Many,b) One,c) Two,d) Three,c,Explanation: In running a whole RNA extract you will get 2 bands each corresponding to 60S rRNA and 40S rRNA for eukaryotes and corresponding 30S and 50S for prokaryotes.
Question 809,2. tRNA constitutes ___________ % of all RNA.,a) 85,b) 25,c) 15,d) <5,c,Explanation: tRNA constitutes only 15% of the entire RNA. Major portion of 5& is the rRNA while very small portion is the mRNA.
Question 810,3. The pre-rRNA transcript transcribed by the RNA pol IdoesnÕt include_________,a) 18S,b) 5S,c) 5.8S,d) 28S,b,"Explanation: White the 18S, 5.8 S and the 28S subunits are present in the pre rRNA transcript, the 5S subunit comes from another region that is transcribed by the RNA pol III."

Question 896,5. How are the cells sorted?,a) By dilution plating until there are only single cell in each well of microtitre plate,b) By the differential weight,c) By electrostatic force,d) By magnetic force,c,Explanation: As the cells exit the nozzle of the flow cytometer a small amount of charge is added to the droplet. Then it passes between the two places which induce the droplet to be properly separated depending on its label.
Question 897,6. In a flow cytometer you will see the cells lacking both the labels in ____________ quadrant.,a) 1st,b) 2nd,c) 3rd,d) 4th,c,Explanation: In the 1st quadrant and 4th quadrant one of the two labels are active. In the 2nd both are active and in the 3rd none of the labels are present on the molecule.
Question 898,7. Which fluorescent dye can be used for red fluorescence?,a) Rhodamine,b) Fluorescein,c) Carmine,d) DAPI,a,Explanation: The Rhodamine gives red fluorescence while the fluorescein gives a green fluorescence. Carmine is a red dye that is used in food but itÕs not used for immunological methods. DAPI stains the nucleus blue.
Question 899,8. Which of the following drugs effect caspases?,a) Oblimerson,b) Pikan083,c) Tenovin,d) Apoptin,d,"Explanation: Apoptin, a caspase-inducing agent, has been reported to induce apoptosis in malignant but not in normal cells. Small molecules caspase activators are peptides which contain the arginine-glycine-aspartate motif. They induce activation of procaspase 3. "
