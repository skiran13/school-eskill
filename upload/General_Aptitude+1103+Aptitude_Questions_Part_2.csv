Question 172,How many number of times will the digit 7 be written when listing the integers from 1 to 1000?,271,300,252,304,B, 7 does not occur in 1000. So we have to count the number of times it appears between 1 and 999. Any number between 1 and 999 can be expressed in the form of xyz where 0 < x y z < 9.1. The numbers in which 7 occurs only once. e.g 7 17 78 217 743 etcThis means that 7 is one of the digits and the remaining two digits will be any of the other 9 digits (i.e 0 to 9 with the exception of 7)You have 1*9*9 = 81 such numbers. However 7 could appear as the first or the second or the third digit. Therefore there will be 3*81 = 243 numbers (1-digit 2-digits and 3- digits) in which 7 will appear only once.In each of these numbers 7 is written once. Therefore 243 times.2. The numbers in which 7 will appear twice. e.g 772 or 377 or 747 or 77In these numbers one of the digits is not 7 and it can be any of the 9 digits ( 0 to 9 with the exception of 7).There will be 9 such numbers. However this digit which is not 7 can appear in the first or second or the third place. So there are 3 * 9 = 27 such numbers.In each of these 27 numbers the digit 7 is written twice. Therefore 7 is written 54 times.3. The number in which 7 appears thrice - 777 - 1 number. 7 is written thrice in it.Therefore the total number of times the digit 7 is written between 1 and 999 is 243 + 54 + 3 = 300

Question 178,How many alphabets need to be there in a language if one were to make 1 million distinct 3 digit initials using the alphabets of the language?,100,50,26,1000,A, 1 million distinct 3 digit initials are needed.Let the number of required alphabets in the language be 'n'.Therefore using 'n' alphabets we can form n *n *n = n3 distinct 3 digit initials.NOTE:Distinct initials are different from initials where the digits are different. For instance AAA and BBB are acceptable combinations in the case of distinct initials while they are not permitted when the digits of the initials need to be different.This n3 different initials = 1 million.i.e. n3 = 106 (1 million =106).n3 = 1023.=> n = 102 = 100.Hence the language needs to have a minimum of 100 alphabets
Question 179,How many arrangements of four 0's (zeroes) two 1's and two 2's are there in which the first 1 occur before the first 2?,420,360,320,210,D, Total number of arrangements = [8! /(4! *2! *2!)]= 420.Since there are two 1's and two 0's the number of arrangements in which the first 1 is before the first 2 is same as the number of arrangement in which the first 2 is before the first 1 and they are each equal to half the total number of arrangements = 210.
Question 180,How many different five-letter words can be formed using the letter from the world APPLE?,24,60,120,240,B, If the two P‰Ûªs were distinct (they could have different subscripts and colours) the number of possible permutations would have been 5! =120.For example let us consider one permutation: P1LEAP2.Now if we permute the P‰Ûªs amongst them we still get the same word PLEAP. The two P‰Ûªs can be permuted amongst them in 2! ways.We were counting P1LEAP2 and P2LEAP1 as different arrangements only because we were artificially distinguishing between the two P‰Ûªs Hence the number of different five letter words that can be formed is:5!/2!= 4 *4 *3 = 60
